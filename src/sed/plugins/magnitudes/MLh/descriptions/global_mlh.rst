Amplitude
---------

The MLh amplitude calculation is very similar to the original :ref:`ML<global_ml>`.
The two differences are:

- It uses the maximum of the two horizontal components (average can be configured if necessary)
- It uses zero-to-peak in stead of peak-to-peak values

Zero-to-peak is calculated by just dividing the peak-to-peak amplitude by two.
This is not exact for unsymmetrical signals, but that doesn't matter because the
code actually generates zero-to-peak amplitudes internally and multiplies them
with two. So in the end we get real zero-to-peak values.

Station Magnitude
-----------------

The MLh plugin calculates the individual station magnitude using the following formula:

.. math::

   mag = \log10(waamp1) + A \times hypdistkm + B

waampl is the amplitude produced by the MLh plugin. Hypdistkm is the distance
from the sensor to the hypocenter in kilometers. A and B are parameters that
can be configured in a config file. Several pairs of A and B can be configured
for different ranges of hypocenter distance.

* Amplitude unit in SeisComP3: **millimeter** (mm)
* Time window: 150 s by :ref:`scautopick` or distance dependent
* Distance range: 0 - 20 deg
* Depth range: 0 - 80 km

Network Magnitude
-----------------

To compute the network magnitude from station magnitudes the SED standard is applied
by computing the median value of all contributing station magnitudes without any trimming.

Configuration
-------------

Add the *mlh* plugin to the existing plugins in the global configuration.
Set the calibration parameters in the global bindings to compute MLh.
There exist no default configuration. Add MLh to the list of
amplitudes and magnitudes in the configuration of :ref:`scamp` and :ref:`scmag` for computation
and in :ref:`scesv` for visibility.
