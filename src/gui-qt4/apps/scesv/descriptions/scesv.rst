scesv is the summary display of the event parameters. It shows the primary information
about the current event including location, time, strength, type and processing status.
Additional to the current event older events can also be chosen from the eventlist in the
events tab.

The two tabs of scesv are shown in :ref:`fig-events` and :ref:`fig-summary`.
The events tab shows the eventlist of the time span defined on the bottom side of the window.
