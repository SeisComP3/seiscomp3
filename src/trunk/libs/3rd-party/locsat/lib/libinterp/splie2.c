 * NAME
 *      splie2 -- Construct natural splines and second derivatives.

 * FILE
 *      splie2.c

 * SYNOPSIS
 *      Perform 1-D natural cubic splines on rows and return the second
 *	derivatives.
 
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      Function.  Given a tabulated function ya[1..m][1..n], and 
 *	tabulated independent variables x1a[1..m] and x2a[1..n], this 
 *	routine constructs one-dimensional natural cubic splines of the 
 *	rows of ya and returns the second derivatives in the array 
 *	y2a[1..m][1..n].  This routine only needs to be called once,
 *	and then, any number of bi-cubic spline interpolations can be
 *	performed by successive calls to splin2.

 *	---- Functions called ----
 *		spline:	Return 2nd derivatives of an interpolating function

 * DIAGNOSTICS
 *	Values returned larger than 1.0e30 signal a natual spline.
