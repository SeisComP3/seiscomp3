The RecordStream used by an application is either specified on the
commandline (`-I URI`) or configured through using the parameter
:confval:`recordstream` and :confval:`recordstream`.

.. _rs-slink:

SeedLink
--------

This RecordStream fetches data from a SeedLink server. The source is read as an
URL and supports URL encoded parameters. The default host is set to
`localhost`, the default port to `18000`. Optional parameters are:

- `timeout` - connection timeout in seconds, default: 300
- `retries` - number of connection retry attempts, default: 0
- `no-batch` - disables BATCH mode to request data, does not take a value

Examples
^^^^^^^^

- ``slink://``
- ``slink://geofon.gfz-potsdam.de?timeout=60&retries=5``
- ``slink://localhost:18042``

.. _rs-arclink:

ArcLink
-------

This RecordStream fetches data from a ArcLink server. The source is read as an
URL and supports URL encoded parameters. The default host is set to
`localhost`, the default port to `18001`. Optional parameters are:

- `user` - user name required on some servers
- `pwd` - password required on some servers
- `dump` - optional output file for all records being received

Examples
^^^^^^^^

- ``arclink://``
- ``arclink://geofon.gfz-potsdam.de?user=foo&pwd=secret``
- ``arclink://localhost:18042``
- ``arclink://localhost?dump=test.mseed``

.. _rs-fdsnws:

FDSNWS
------

This RecordStream fetches data from a FDSN Web service. The source is read as an
URL.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

- ``fdsnws://service.iris.edu:80/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query``

.. _rs-file:

File
----

This RecordStream reads data from a file. The source is read as an file path. If
the source is set to `'-'` the data is read from `stdin`. By default the record
type is set to `mseed`. If a file name extension is available the record type is
set as follows:

========= ===========
Extension Record Type
========= ===========
`*.xml`   `xml`
`*.bin`   `binary`
`*.mseed` `mseed`
========= ===========

Examples
^^^^^^^^

- ``file://-``
- ``file:///tmp/input.mseed``

.. _rs-sdsarchive:

SDSArchive
----------

This RecordStream reads data from one or more SeisComP (SDS) archives using the
:ref:`rs-file` RecordStream. The source is interpreted as a directory path list
separated using commas.

Example
^^^^^^^

- ``sdsarchive:///home/sysop/seiscomp3/var/lib/archive``

- ``sdsarchive:///SDSA,/SDSB,/SDSC``

Different SDS are not merged, but are read sequentially depending on data existence.
If a requested file is missing in the current SDS it is searched on the next archive
in the list. On success it will deliver all the rest of files for the current channel
from this SDS archive. On failure the next SDS archive is searched.

This process is repeated for each requested channel individually. It always starts to
search data from the first given SDS to the last one, for each data channel.

.. _rs-odcarchive:

ODCArchive
----------

This RecordStream reads data from an ODC archive using the :ref:`rs-file`
RecordStream. The source is interpreted as a directory path.

Example
^^^^^^^

- ``odcarchive:///path/to/record/archive``

.. _rs-memory:

Memory
------

This RecordStream reads data from memory and is only useful for developing
applications. For instance a record sequence stored in an internal buffer could
be passed to an instance of this RecordStream for reading.

.. _rs-combined:

Combined
--------

This RecordStream combines one archive and one real-time RecordStream, e.g.
:ref:`rs-arclink` and :ref:`rs-slink`. First the archive stream is read up to
the size of the real-time buffer. Then the acquisition is switched to the
real-time stream. The syntax for the source is similar to an URL:

``combined://real-time-stream;archive-stream??parameters``

By default the real-time stream is set to :ref:`rs-slink` and the
archive-stream is set to :ref:`rs-arclink`. Any other streams may be configured.
The parameters of the combined stream are separated by 2 question marks (`??`)
in order to distinguish them from the parameters used in the proxy streams:

- `slinkMax|rtMax|1stMax` - Buffer size in seconds of the first stream
  (typically the real-time stream), default: 3600

  Time spans can be configured with an additional and optional suffix:

  ======  =============
  Suffix  Multiplicator
  ======  =============
  s       1
  m       60
  h       3600
  d       86400
  w       86400*7
  ======  =============

- `splitTime` - The absolute time of the separation of both sources. The argument
  is an ISO time string, e.g. 2018-05-10T12:00:00Z or a year, e.g. 2018, which is
  the same as 2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z.
  `splitTime` can be used if the waveform archives are spread over several directories
  or harddisks. See also the :ref:`examples<rs_splitTime>`.

The combined record stream may be nested allowing the configuration of a
(theoretically) infinite number of archive streams. The syntax for a nested
configuration uses parenthesis:

``combined://real-time-stream;combined/(archive-stream1;archive-stream2??parameters)??parameters``

.. _rs-balanced:

Balanced
--------

This RecordStream distributes requests quasi-equally (but deterministically) to
multiple proxy streams. It can be used for load balancing and to improve failure
tolerance. The algorithm to choose a proxy stream (counting from 0) is based on
station code and can be expressed in Python as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   stationCode = "WLF"
   nproxies = 2

   x = 0
   for c in stationCode:
       x += ord(c)

   print("choosing proxy stream", x % nproxies)

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table::
   :header: "URL", "Description"

   "``balanced://slink/server1:18000;slink/server2:18000``", "Distribute requests to 2 :ref:`rs-slink` RecordStreams"
   "``balanced://combined/(server1:18000;server1:18001);combined/(server2:18000;server2:18001)``", "Distribute requests to 2 :ref:`rs-combined` RecordStreams"

.. _rs-dec:

Decimation
----------

This RecordStream decimates (resamples) a proxy stream, e.g. :ref:`rs-slink`.
The syntax for the source is similar to an URL:

``dec://proxy-stream?parameters/address``

Optional parameters are:

- `rate` - target sampling rate in Hz, default: 1
- `fp` - default: 0.7
- `fs` - default: 0.9
- `cs` - coefficient scale, default: 10

Examples
^^^^^^^^

- ``dec://slink/localhost:18000``
- ``dec://file?rate=2/-``
- ``dec://combined/;``

.. _rs-resample:

Resample
--------

This RecordStream resamples (up or down) a proxy stream, e.g. :ref:`rs-slink`,
to a given sampling rate. The syntax for the source is similar to an URL:

``resample://proxy-stream?parameters/address``

Optional parameters are:

- `rate` - target sampling rate in Hz, default: 1
- `fp` - default: 0.7
- `fs` - default: 0.9
- `cs` - coefficient scale, default: 10
- `lw` - lanczos kernel width, default: 3
- `debug` - enables debug output, default: false


Examples
^^^^^^^^

- ``resample://slink/localhost:18000``
- ``resample://file?rate=2/-``
- ``resample://combined/;``
