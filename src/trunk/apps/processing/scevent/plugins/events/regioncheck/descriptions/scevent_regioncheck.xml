				Set the event type to &quot;outside of network interest&quot;
				if the location is inside or outside preconfigured regions of
				rejection or acceptance, respectively. The regions are defined by
				BNA polygons. Add the plugin &quot;evrc&quot; to the  plugins

					<description>
					The list of closed BNA polygon names defining regions of
					acceptance or rejection of events. The polygon names define
					regions of event acceptance but names with prefix !  (exclamation mark)
					define regions of rejection. Evaluation is done in the order of the
					polygons. The last matching criteria applies. If events ARE NOT
					within regions of acceptance or ARE within regions of
					rejection their type is set to &quot;outside of network interest&quot;.
					Default: &quot;reject&quot;, use &quot;accecpt&quot; to overwrite the default.

					Examples:

					Accept events within the polygon &quot;germany&quot;:

					germany

					Accept all events but reject events within the polygon &quot;quarries&quot;:

					accept,!quarries

					Accept events within the polygon &quot;germany&quot; but reject events within the polygon &quot;quarries&quot;:

					germany,!quarries

					Accept all events but reject events within the polygon &quot;germany&quot; and accept events within the polygon &quot;saxony&quot;:

					accept,!germany,saxony
