					<description>
					The list of closed BNA polygon names defining regions for
					flagging event as positive or negative.
					A polygon name defines a positive region but names with prefix !  (exclamation mark)
					define negative regions. Evaluation is done in the order of the
					polygons. The last matching criteria applies and the event type
					is set accordingly.

					Default: If events are not positive or are negative regions the
					event type is set to &quot;outside of network interest&quot;.
					Default: &quot;!reject&quot;, use &quot;accecpt&quot; to overwrite the default.

					Examples:

					Events are flagged positive within the polygon &quot;germany&quot;:

					germany

					All events are flagged positive but events within the polygon &quot;quarries&quot; are negative:

					accept,!quarries

					Events within the polygon &quot;germany&quot; are flagged positive but
					all other events and events within the polygon &quot;quarries&quot; are negaitve:

					germany,!quarries

					All events are flagged positive but events within the polygon &quot;germany&quot;
					are negative and all events within the polygon &quot;saxony&quot; are positive:

					accept,!germany,saxony
