			<parameter name="port" type="int" default="18000">
				<description>
				The port of the Seedlink server to connect to. If the acquisition
				is running on one system this port must match the configured
				local Seedlink port.

			</parameter>
			<parameter name="archive" type="string" default="var/lib/archive">
				<description>
				Path to waveform archive where all data is stored. Relative paths

				<description>
				Number of records (512 byte units) to buffer before flushing to
				disk.

			</parameter>
			<parameter name="delay" type="int" default="30" unit="s">
				<description>
				The network reconnect delay (in seconds) for the connection

			</parameter>
			<parameter name="networkTimeout" type="int" default="900" unit="s">
				<description>
				The network timeout (in seconds) for the connection to the
				SeedLink server. If no data [or keep alive packets?] are received
				in this time range the connection is closed and re-established
				(after the reconnect delay has expired). The default value is
				600 seconds. A value of 0 disables the timeout.

			</parameter>
			<parameter name="idleTimeout" type="int" default="300" unit="s">
				<description>
				Timeout for closing idle data stream files in seconds. The idle

			<parameter name="keepalive" type="int" default="0" unit="s">
				<description>
				Interval (in seconds) at which keepalive (heartbeat) packets

					If the signature check is enabled slarchive loads all files at start. The store
					uses the OpenSSl store format. From the offical OpenSSL documentation:
					"The directory should contain one certificate or CRL per file in PEM format,
					with a file name of the form hash.N for a certificate, or hash.rN for a CRL.
					The .N or .rN suffix is a sequence number that starts at zero, and is incremented
					consecutively for each certificate or CRL with the same hash value. Gaps in the
					sequence numbers are not supported, it is assumed that there are no more objects
					with the same hash beyond the first missing number in the sequence.The .N or .rN suffix

					each certificate or CRL with the same hash value. Gaps in the sequence numbers
					are not supported, it is assumed that there are no more objects with the same
					hash beyond the first missing number in the sequence."
					The hash value can be obtained as follows:

					openssl x509 -hash -noout -in &lt;file&gt;

				Address ([host][:][port]) is a required argument. It specifies the address
				of the SeedLink server in host:port format. Either the host, port or both
				can be omitted. If host is omitted then localhost is assumed,
				i.e. ':18000' implies 'localhost:18000'. If the port is omitted
				then 18000 is assumed, i.e. 'localhost' implies 'localhost:18000'.
				If only ':' is specified 'localhost:18000' is assumed.

					<description>
						During client shutdown the last received sequence numbers and time stamps (start times)

						client can be stopped and started without data loss, assuming the data are still available on the
						server. If an interval is specified the state will be saved every interval in that packets are
						received. Otherwise the state will be saved only on normal program termination.

						overlap limit in seconds to the option. If the overlap is exceeded an error message will be
						logged once for each time the file is opened. This option makes sense only for archive formats
						where each unique data stream is written to a unique file (e.g. SDS format). If a data stream
						is closed due to timeout (see option -i) the initial future check will be preformed when the
