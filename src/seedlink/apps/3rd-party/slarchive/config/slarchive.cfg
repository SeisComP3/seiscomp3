# documentation: "The directory should contain one certificate or CRL per file
# in PEM format, with a file name of the form hash.N for a certificate, or
# hash.rN for a CRL. The .N or .rN suffix is a sequence number that starts at
# zero, and is incremented consecutively for each certificate or CRL with the
# same hash value. Gaps in the sequence numbers are not supported, it is
# assumed that there are no more objects with the same hash beyond the first
# missing number in the sequence.The .N or .rN suffix is a sequence number that
# starts at zero, and is incremented consecutively for each certificate or CRL
# with the same hash value. Gaps in the sequence numbers are not supported, it

# missing number in the sequence." The hash value can be obtained as follows:
