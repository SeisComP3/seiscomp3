2019.119/JB: version 1.8-sc3
	- Authentication support for signatures in opaque data blockette
	- Update to libslink 2.7 (2.6 + blockette 2000)

2009.240/AH: version 1.7-sc3
	- Batchmode support.

2009.116/AH:
	- Improve performance with large number of streams.

2007.205/AH:
	- Update to libslink 1.7

2006.213: 1.7
	- Release without changes after testing.

2005.237:
	- Search for a matching file name (glob) when opening archive
	files using non-defining flags.  The problem was that stream
        timeouts or slarchive re-starts cause files to be re-opened
	generating new files using the non-defining flags as if they were
	defining.

2005.147: version 1.6
	- Update to libslink 1.5.
	- Add version to usage messages.
	- Update man page.

2004.222: version 1.5
	- Update to libslink 1.4.
	- Either host or port is optional when specifying the
        SeedLink server (libslink parses the string now).
	- Remove the dummy signal handler as it was useless.

2004.197: version 1.4
	- Update to libslink 1.3 including redirection of most library
	output to stderr.
	- Do not adjust ppackets flag based on verbose flag.  If packet
        details are desired they must specifically be requested.

2004.184:
	- Migrate all standard I/O (fopen, fwrite, etc.) to the raw
	interfaces (open, write, etc.) in order to be able to open more
	files at once; standard I/O is limited to 256 descriptors.
	- Agressively deal with the situation where the maximum open files
	limit has been reached.  First, try to increase the "soft" limit
	to the "hard" limit.  Second, close open stream files with
	decreasing idle timeouts until some file descriptors are freed.
	The result is that slarchive should almost always be able to open
	files (and save data) even if the number of incoming streams is
	large.  If the open file limit is low versus the number of
	incoming streams there might be lots of opening and closing of
	files.  This change involved the addition of the ds_openfile and
	ds_closeidle functions to dsarchive.c.
	- If '-v' is used only set '-p' to level 1 unless it's already
	set, this allows diagnostics to be seen without the output being
	flooded with info about the received packets.

2004.170: version 1.3
	- Update to libslink 1.2a including more flexible support for
        implementations of the SeedLink protocol other than the reference
        implementation by Andres Heinloo.
	- Handle case of corrupt miniSEED records in existing files when
	checking for the last sample received (initial future check) by
	disabling check when the last sample time could not be determined.
	- Add high verbosity log message when reading the last record from
	 existing file.
	
2004.125: version 1.2
	- Update to libslink 1.1 allowing usage under Mac OS X (Darwin).
	- Fix up the usage of '-v' and '-p' to be consistent.
	- Better argument list processing to catch silly user errors when
        options do not have required values.	
	- Consolidate INSTALL and README into README.

2004.026: version 1.1
	- No comments (no users?), bumping version to 1.1

2004.016: version 1.1beta3
	- Prefix all log messages with a local time stamp.
	- Set stdout (where log messages go) to always flush after a
	newline.

2004.014: version 1.1beta2
	- Log messages reporting that overlap limits are exeeded with the
	new '-Fi' and '-Fc' options are supressed after the first message
	as long as the overlap is continuous in the same file.

2004.013:
	- Generalized data stream structures more.  Allows for future grow
	possibilities.  As a side benefit any number of archive
	definitions can now be given, i.e. muliple uses of '-A', '-SDS',
	'-BUD', '-DLOG', or any combination thereof.
	- Fix the missing initilization that caused every other record to
	be skipped when using the new '-F' options.
	- Changed the single '-F' option to two different options, '-Fi'
	and '-Fc'.  The first sets an acceptable overlap for data in the
	future that is checked when data streams are initialized and
	existing data files are opened.  The second sets an acceptable 
	overlap for data in the future that is continuously checked.
	
2003.315: version 1.1beta
	- Add '-F' option to only archive data in the future by keeping
	track of the time of the last sample and skipping any records that
	start before that.  Read the last record from any existing files
	when a datastream is opened so that this will work even through
	a shutdown.  This only makes sense to use for archive formats where
	each unique data stream is archived in a separate file.
	- Add a missing statement for cleanly flushing the
	file buffers of a DLOG archive on shutdown.
	- Fix main description in man page.

	- Update to libslink 1.0

	- Update to libslink 0.9.4.
	- Use gcc by default, the library uses it anyway.
	- Add -O2 and -Wall to the cflags and fix the warnings.

	- Add interval for statefile usage, the statefile will be
	written every interval number of packets received.

2003.262: version 0.8
	- Update to libslink 0.9.1.

	- Only call msr_print() on when verbose is > 0.

2003.182: version 0.6
	- Update to libslink 0.9 and use new termination sequence
	that has no possibility to lose packets.

2003.181: version 0.5
	- Update to libslink 0.8.3 (includes renaming of structures).
	Updates from Andres (thanks):
	- Parse data records even when not doing BUD archiving, oops!
	- Add a setvbuf call to make the writing of records into the
	archive unbuffered.
	- Change checking of archive directory to existence instead of
	writable.
