2009.240/AH: version 4.1b-sc3
	- Mod for SC3 distribution with libxml2 and batchmode support.

2009.050: version 4.1b
	- Update libslink to 2.2b which fixes for Solaris and Win32.

2008.029: version 4.1
	- Update libslink to 2.1 which includes support for building
	with user defined CC and CFLAGS and other minor updates.

2007.284: version 4.0
	- Update libslink to 2.0 which includes support for wildcarded
	network & station codes (when supported by the server) and 
	extended reply/status messages.

2007.218:
	- Add 'b' to fopen mode argument so Win32 platforms write
	output data correctly.

2007.198: version 3.9
	- Update main Makefile.wat for Watcom's wmake (Win32).
	- Update ezxml/Makefile.wat to define EZXML_NOMAP to build.
	- Update src/Makefile.wat with the correct path to libezxml.lib.

2007.039:
	- Add ezxml library to sources and use it instead of libxml2.
	- Incoming INFO XML buffer limited to 10 MB.

2006.355: 
	- Update to libslink 1.7, only API naming changes.
	- Include Makefile.wat and Makefile.win for WIN32. libxml2 is
	required to compile, which might have other dependencies.
	- Numerous small changes for compiling under WIN32: no signal
	handling when WIN32 defined, etc.

2006.027: version 3.8
	- Update to libslink 1.6, no changes.

2005.343: version 3.8rc1
	- Update to libslink 1.6rc1.

2005.147: version 3.7
	- Fix a few small typos.

2005.108:
	- Printing of stream and gap lists will now report when stream
	checking is not enabled on the server if a verbose option is used.

2005.103:
	- Update to libslink 1.5.
	- Update Makefiles to include specific 'gcc', etc. targets.
	- Add version information to default (no arguments) help text.

2004.222: version 3.6
	- Update to libslink 1.4.
	- Either host or port is optional when specifying the
	SeedLink server (libslink parses the string now).
	- Add option '-P' to ping the server and report success/failure. 
	- Remove the dummy signal handler as it was useless.

2004.196: version 3.5
	- Update to libslink 1.3 including redirection of libslink
	internal diagnostic messages to stderr.
	- Change most log messages to be at the diagnostic level, thus
	going to stderr.  Notable exceptions are when printing details
	of received data records (ms_print), when printing unpacked
	samples (print_samples) and when printing INFO responses.
	- Do not adjust ppackets flag based on verbose flag.  If packet
	details are desired they must specifically be requested.
	- Fix usage of '-o -', the new argument processing broke this.

2004.170: version 3.4
	- Update to libslink 1.2a including more flexible support for
	implementations of the SeedLink protocol other than the reference
	implementation by Andres Heinloo. 

2004.125: version 3.3
	- Update to libslink 1.1 allowing usage under Mac OS X (Darwin).
	- Add '-u' option to to unpack samples in data packets and
	print them.
	- Fix up the usage of '-v' and '-p' to be consistent.
	- Better argument list processing to catch silly user errors when
	options do not have required values.
	- Fix handling of multiple INFO requests, first one on the command
	line always wins, the others are properly rejected with a message.
	- Consolidate INSTALL and README into README.
	
2003.309: version 3.2
	- Update to libslink 1.0

2003.307: version 3.2pre1
	- Update to libslink 1.0pre1
        - Add an exception to packet_handler() to not archive
        end-of-detection records in structured data archives.
	These records will still be written to the dump file.
	- Do not archive INFO packets in structured data archives.
	These records will still be written to the dump file.
	
2003.304: version 3.2rc9
	- Finish implementing the state file save-at-interval code.
	Oops! (Thanks Joachim).
	- Fix some typos in the man page.

2003.280: version 3.2rc8
	- Updated to libslink 0.9.6 and do needed changes.

2003.276: version 3.2rc7
	- Updated to libslink 0.9.5 and do needed changes.
	- Removed autoconfig system, too much to maintain for too little
	gain.  Simple Makefiles should cover most cases.
	- Changed to standard flag usage and flexibility.
	- Add [:interval] to statefile specification.
	
2003.181: version 3.2rc6
	- Update to libslink 0.8.3 and rename functions where necessary.
	- Update to fixes made in archiving routines for slarchive.
	- Minor documentation update.

2003.156: version 3.2rc5
	- Update to libslink 0.7 and use the new shutdown procedure.
	
2003.092: version 3.2rc4
	- Updated data stream archiving routines from the slarchive
	  source.

2003.083: version 3.2rc3
	- Fixed memory leak in time window string parsing.
	- Fixed memory leaks in the data stream archiving routines.
	- Updated libslink to 0.6 with memory leak fixes.

2003.077: version 3.2rc1
	- '-s' now specifies default selectors used when none are specified
	  for a given data stream.
	- Added an '-d' option to use "dial-up" mode for the connection.
	- Added an '-A' option to archive data in a user specified
	  directory/file structure.
	- Added an '-SDS' option to save data in an Simple Data Structure.
	- Ported to use the new SeedLink library (libslink), this includes
	  new features:
	    - read a stream list from a file (with the '-l' option)
	    - save the record start times as state information (in the
	      state files) and use them with server versions >= 2.93.
	
2003.034:
	- Fixed latency calculation when sampling rate factor/multiplier
	  is negative.  Aaargg.
	
2003.013: version 3.0
        - Added a test for a channel code of 'ERR' in an INFO response,
	  this indicates that the requested INFO level is not enabled.
        - Change specific INFO options to upper case for clarity.
	- Added an option (-I) to request and parse a response to an
	  INFO ID response.
	- Updated man page.
	
2002.319:
	- Filtered most of the source through 'indent' to have a
	  uniform style (thus hiding the authors ugly shorthand style).
	- Reworked the data record latency calculation for efficieny
	  and clarity (although it was already very simple).
	
2002.315: version 3rc2
	- Fix BUD output file names so they match that used by the DMC.
	  The BUD structure and filename convention:
	  <Net>/<Sta>/Sta.Net.Loc.Chan.Year.JDay
	- Add a few lines to catch a return of 'ERROR\r\n' in the main
	  loop for the response to commands that are unsupported.
	  This is mostly for handling the server response when INFO
	  messages are turned off.
	- Fix a memory leak in strparse().
	- Update up the documentation.

2002.301:
	- Moved the call to sl_sayhello() into sl_connect() instead of
	  sl_configlink() so the version number parsing will occur even
	  for the specific INFO requests.
	
2002.289: version 3rc1
	- Add detection of server version from response to HELLO message
	  and appropriate checks for version level before doing things
	  like requesting INFO messages and multi-station negotiation.
	
2002.287:
	- Implement BUD structure saving capability, slinktool can now
	  save all received data records to a BUD dir/file structure.
	
2002.269:
	- Implement state file capability, slinktool can now save and 
	  recover sequence numbers from a state file.

2002.266:
	- Renamed project to slinktool
	- Merge Andres Heinloo's updates and XML handling code, Thanks!
	  This includes many new features for Seedlink 3.0 servers.
	- Implemented automake/autoconf system for configuration, this is
	  mostly to find libxml2 and determine byte order in a portable way.
	- Re-format the most of the source for readability (hopefully)
	- Implement keepalive using INFO level ID requests.
	
2002.154: version 1.7b
	- extended a check for 'D' in the 'data header/quality indicator'
	  field of a fixed data header as per. SEED version 2.4.  This
	  value can now be 'D', 'R' or 'Q'.
	
2002.129: version 1.7a
	- Added some logic to fail during link configuration if either no
	  given selectors or no given stations (multi-station mode only)
	  were accepted.  This should avoid confusion for users that 
	  receive unexpected data because their specified selectors or
	  stations were not accepted by the server.  Note: selectors,
	  unlike stations, will only fail if they are malformed;
	  acceptance does not mean that data fitting that selector mask
	  is available.
	- Provide separate Makefile's for Linux and Sun/Solaris just for
	  convenience.

2002.101: version 1.7
	- Added some code to select() while reading data records from
	  the network.  Subsequently removed the usleep() call in the main
	  loop.  This significantly improves the data transport rate,
	  which is not too important in this command line client but is
	  important in the sister-project slink2orb.
	- Re-worked the timing logic in the main loop for the network delay
	  and timeout so it is easier to read/modify later.
	
2002.008:
	- Removed some unused variables. woo hoo.
	
2002.007: version 1.6
	- Fix a small memory leak and do some cleanups
	
2001.353: version 1.5
	- Updated the slinkutils.c client functions with minor bugfixes
	
2001.346: version 1.3
	- If host is omitted for SeedLink server address then localhost
	is assumed, i.e. ':18000' implies 'localhost:18000'
	- Addition of information in messages
	- Reorganize client functions (slinkutils.c)
	
2001.340: version 1.2
	- Minor code cleanups.

2001.313: version 1.1
        - Added the ability to parse blockettes 100 and 1001, in addition
        to the 1000 blockette.
        - Added a rough data latency calculator (based on the system clock
	in UTC).


2001.305: first version
	- Connects using both uni and multi-station mode, no keep alive
	handling as this feature does not exist in any servers yet.
	- All received packets can be dumped to a file, no byte swapping
	or other modification is performed.
	- miniSEED header details are reported with two verbose flags (-vv).
