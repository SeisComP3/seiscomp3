.SH NAME
slinktool \- SeedLink client for data stream inspection, data collection
and server testing

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
slinktool [options] [host][:][port]

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBslinktool\fP connects to a \fISeedLink\fR server and queries the
server for informaion or requests data using uni-station or
multi-station mode and prints information about the packets received.
All received packets can optionally be dumped to a single file or
saved in custom directory and file layouts.

.SH OPTIONS

.IP "-V         "
Report program version and exit.

.IP "-h         "
Print program usage and exit.

.IP "-v         "
Be more verbose.  This flag can be used multiple times ("-v -v" or
"-vv") for more verbosity.  One flag: report basic handshaking (link
configuration) details and briefly report each packet received.  Two
flags: report the details of the handshaking, each packet received and
detailed connection diagnostics.

.IP "-P         "
Ping the server: connect, print out the server ID and exit.  If the
server was successfully contacted the return code will be 0, if errors
were encountered the return code will be 1.

.IP "-p         "
Print details of received Mini-SEED data records. This flag can be
used multiple times ("-p -p" or "-pp") for more detail.  One flag: a
single summary line for each data packet received.  Two flags: details
of the Mini-SEED data records received, including information from
fixed header and 100/1000/1001 blockettes.

.IP "-u         "
Print data samples in data packets, implies at least one -p flag.

.IP "-nd \fIdelay\fR"
The network reconnect delay (in seconds) for the connection to
the SeedLink server.  If the connection breaks for any reason
this will govern how soon a reconnection should be attempted.
The default value is 30 seconds.

.IP "-nt \fItimeout\fR"
The network timeout (in seconds) for the connection to the SeedLink
server.  If no data [or keep alive packets?] are received in this 
time the connection is closed and re-established (after the 
reconnect delay has expired).  The default value is 600 seconds.
A value of 0 disables the timeout.

.IP "-k \fIkeepalive\fR  (requires SeedLink >= 3)"
Keepalive packet interval (in seconds) at which keepalive (heartbeat)
packets are sent to the server.  Keepalive packets are only sent if
nothing is received within the interval.

.IP "-x \fIstatefile\fR[:\fIinterval\fR]"
During client shutdown the last received sequence numbers and time
stamps (start times) for each data stream will be saved in this file.
If this file exists upon startup the information will be used to
resume the data streams from the point at which they were stopped.  In
this way the client can be stopped and started without data loss,
assuming the data are still available on the server.  If
\fIinterval\fR is specified the state will be saved every
\fIinterval\fR packets that are received.  Otherwise the state will be
saved only on normal program termination.

.IP "-d"
Configure the connection in "dial-up" mode.  The remote server will
close the connection when it has sent all of the data in it's buffers
for the selected data streams.  This is opposed to the normal behavior
of waiting indefinately for data.

.IP "-o \fIdumpfile\fR"
If specified, all packets (Mini-SEED records) received will be
appended to this file.  The file is created if it does not exist.  A
special mode for this option is to send all received packets to
standard output when the dumpfile is specified as '-'.  In this case
all output besides these records will be redirected to standard error.

.IP "-A \fIformat\fR"
If specified, all packets (Mini-SEED records) received will be
appended to a directory/file structure defined by \fBformat\fP.
All directories implied in the \fBformat\fP string will be created if
necessary.  See the section \fIArchiving data\fR.

.IP "-SDS \fISDSdir\fR"
If specified, all packets (Mini-SEED records) received will be
saved into a Simple Data Structure (SDS) dir/file structure
starting at the specified directory.  This directory and all
subdirectories will be created if necessary.  This option is
esentially a preset version of '-A' option.  The SDS dir/file
structure is:
.nf
<SDSdir>/<YEAR>/<NET>/<STA>/<CHAN.TYPE>/NET.STA.LOC.CHAN.TYPE.YEAR.DAY
.fi

.IP "-BUD \fIBUDdir\fR"
If specified, all waveform data packets (Mini-SEED data records)
received will be saved into a Buffer of Uniform Data (BUD) dir/file
structure starting at the specified directory.  This directory and all
subdirectories will be created if necessary.  This option is
esentially a preset version of '-A' option.  The BUD dir/file
structure is:
.nf
<BUDdir>/<NET>/<STA>/STA.NET.LOC.CHAN.YEAR.DAY
.fi

.IP "-s \fIselectors\fR"
This defines default selectors.  If no multi-station data streams are
configured these selectors will be used for uni-station mode.
Otherwise these selectors will be used when no selectors are specified
for a given stream using the '-S' or '-l' options.

.IP "-l \fIstreamfile\fR"
A list of streams will be read from the given file.  This option
implies multi-station mode.  The format of the stream list file is
given below in the section \fIStream list file\fR.

.IP "-S \fIstream[:selectors],...\fR  (requires SeedLink >= 2.5)"
A list of streams is given as an argument.  This option implies
multi-station mode.  The stream list is composed of multiple streams
(stations) and optional selectors.  \fIstream\fR should be provided in
NET_STA format and \fIselectors\fR are normal SeedLink selectors, see
examples and notes below.  If no selectors are provided for a given
stream, the default selectors, if defined, will be used.

.IP "-tw \fIstart:[end]\fR  (requires SeedLink >= 3)"
Specifies a time window applied, by the server, to data streams.
The format for both times is year,month,day,hour,min,sec; for example:
"2002,08,05,14,00:2002,08,05,14,15,00".
The end time is optional but the colon must be present.  If no end
time is specified the server will send data indefinately.  This option
will override any saved state information.

Warning: time windowing might be disabled on the remote server.

.IP "-i \fIlevel\fR  (requires SeedLink >= 3)"
Send an information request (INFO); the returned raw XML response
is displayed.  Possible levels are: ID, CAPABILITIES, STATIONS,
STREAMS, GAPS, CONNECTIONS, ALL.
.PP
Formatted INFO shortcuts (formats the XML for readability):

.nf
-I   print server id/version and exit
-L   print station list and exit
-Q   print stream list and exit
-G   print gap list and exit
-C   print connection list and exit
.fi

Warning: informational (INFO) messages might be disabled on the server.

.IP "\fI[host][:][port]\fR"
A required argument, specifies the address of the SeedLink server in
host:port format.  Either the host, port or both can be omitted.  If
host is omitted then localhost is assumed, i.e. ':18000'
implies 'localhost:18000'.  If the port is omitted then 18000 is
assumed, i.e. 'localhost' implies 'localhost:18000'.  If only ':' is
specified 'localhost:18000' is assumed.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
All-station/Uni-station mode example:
.IP
The following would connect to a SeedLink server at slink.host.com
port 18000 and configure the link in all-station/uni-station mode,
exactly which data are received depends on the data being served by
the SeedLink server on that particular port.  Additionally, all of the
received packets are appended to the file 'data.mseed' and each packet
received is reported on the standard output.

.B >slinktool -v -o data.mseed slink.host.com:18000

The '-s' argument could be used to indicate selectors to limit the
type of packets sent by the SeedLink server (without selectors all
packet types are sent).  The following would limit this connection
to BHZ channel waveform data with a location code of 10 (see an
explanation of SeedLink selectors below).  Additionally another
verbose flag is given, causing slinktool to report detailed
header information from data records.

.B >slinktool -vv -s 10BHZ.D -o data.mseed slink.host.com:18000

.PP
Multi-station mode example:
.IP
The following example would connect to a SeedLink server on
localhost port 18010 and configure the link in multi-station
mode.  Each station specified with the '-S' argument will be
requested, optionally specifying selectors for each station.

.nf
.B >slinktool -v -S GE_WLF,MN_AQU:00???,IU_KONO:BHZ.D :18010
.fi

This would request GEOFON station WLF (all data as no selectors
were indicated), MedNet station AQU with location code 00 (all
channels) and IU network station KONO (only waveform data) from
channel BHZ.

Of course, a variety of different data selections can be made
(only one '-S' option):

.nf
.B -s 'BHE.D BHN.D' -S 'GE_STU,GE_MALT,GE_WLF'
  (horizontal BH channels, data only)
.B -s BHZ -S GE_STU,GE_WLF,GE_RUE,GE_EIL
  (vertical channels only)
.fi

.PP
Wildcarding network and station codes
.IP
Some SeedLink implementation support wildcarding of the network and
station codes, when this is the case the only two wildcard characters
recognized are '*' for one or more characters and '?' for any single
character.

As an example, all US network data can be requested using the
following syntax:

.nf
-B -S 'US_*
.fi

.SH "SeedLink SELECTORS"

SeedLink selectors are used to request specific types of data within a
given data stream, in effect limiting the default action of sending
all data types.  A data packet is sent to the client if it matches any
positive selector (without leading "!") and doesn't match any negative
selectors (with a leading "!").  The general format of selectors is
LLSSS.T, where LL is location, SSS is channel and T is type (one of
[DECOTL] for Data, Event, Calibration, Blockette, Timing, and Log
records).  "LL", ".T", and "LLSSS." can be omitted, implying anything
in that field.  It is also possible to use "?" in place of L and S as
a single character wildcard.  Multiple selectors are separated by
space(s).

.nf
Some examples:
BH?          - BHZ, BHN, BHE (all record types)
00BH?.D      - BHZ, BHN, BHE with location code '00' (data records)
BH? !E       - BHZ, BHN, BHE (excluding detection records)
BH? E        - BHZ, BHN, BHE & detection records of all channels
!LCQ !LEP    - exclude LCQ and LEP channels
!L !T        - exclude log and timing records
.fi

.SH "Archiving data"
Using the '-A \fBformat\fP' option received data can be saved in a
custom directory and file structure.  The archive \fBformat\fP
argument is expanded for each packet processed using the following
flags:

.nf
  \fBn\fP : network code, white space removed
  \fBs\fP : station code, white space removed
  \fBl\fP : location code, white space removed
  \fBc\fP : channel code, white space removed
  \fBY\fP : year, 4 digits
  \fBy\fP : year, 2 digits zero padded
  \fBj\fP : day of year, 3 digits zero padded
  \fBH\fP : hour, 2 digits zero padded
  \fBM\fP : minute, 2 digits zero padded
  \fBS\fP : second, 2 digits zero padded
  \fBF\fP : fractional seconds, 4 digits zero padded
  \fB%\fP : the percent (%) character
  \fB#\fP : the number (#) character
  \fBt\fP : single character type code:
         D - waveform data packet
         E - detection packet 
         C - calibration packet 
         T - timing packet 
         L - log packet 
         O - opaque data packet 
         U - unknown/general packet 
         I - INFO packet
         ? - unidentifiable packet
.fi

The flags are prefaced with either the \fB%\fP or \fB#\fP modifier.
The \fB%\fP modifier indicates a defining flag while the \fB#\fP
indicates a non-defining flag.  All received packets with the same set
of defining flags will be saved to the same file. Non-defining flags
will be expanded using the values in the first packet received for the
resulting file name.

Time flags are based on the start time of the given packet.

For example, the format string:

\fB/archive/%n/%s/%n.%s.%l.%c.%Y.%j\fP

would be expanded to day length files named something like:

\fB/archive/NL/HGN/NL.HGN..BHE.2003.055\fP

Using non-defining flags the format string:

\fB/data/%n.%s.%Y.%j.%H:#M:#S.miniseed\fP

would be expanded to:

\fB/data/NL.HGN.2003.044.14:17:54.miniseed\fP

resulting in hour length files because the minute and second are
specified with the non-defining modifier.  The minute and second
fields are from the first packet in the file.

.SH "Stream list file"
The stream list file used with the '-l' option is expected to
define a data stream on each line.  The format of each line is:

.nf
<net> <station> [selectors]
.fi

The selectors are optional.  If default selectors are also specified
(with the '-s' option), they they will be used when no selectors are
specified for a given stream.  An example file follows:

.nf
----  Begin example file -----
# Comment lines begin with a '#' or '*'
# Example stream list file for use with the -l argument of slclient or
# with the sl_read_streamlist() libslink function.
GE ISP  BH?.D
NL HGN
MN AQU  BH? HH?
----  End example file -----
.fi

.SH "NOTES"
All diagnostic output from slinktool is printed to standard error
(stderr), exceptions are when printing Mini-SEED packet details (the
-p flag), when printing unpacked samples (the -u flag) and when
printing the raw or formatted responses to INFO requests.

SeedLink is currently distributed as part of the SeisComP
(Seismological Communication Processor) package.  For more
