* Use the command 'serial_plugin -m' to find out which protocols are
* supported.
protocol=guralp2

* Serial port 
port=$sources.dm24.comport

* Baud rate

time_offset=0

* Maximum number of consecutive zeros in datastream before data gap will be
* declared (-1 = disabled).

* names. Channel names are arbitrary 1..10-letter identifiers which should
* match the input names of the stream processing scheme in streams.xml,
* which is referenced from seedlink.ini
