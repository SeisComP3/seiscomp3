.SH NAME
sl_request_info \- add INFO request to SeedLink Connection Description

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <libslink.h>
.sp
.BI "int \fBsl_request_info\fP (SLCD *" slconn ", char *" infostr ");
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Designed to work in conjuntion with \fBsl_collect\fP, the
\fBsl_request_info\fP function adds an INFO request to the connection
description \fIslconn\fP.  The INFO request specified with
\fIinfostr\fP will be sent to the server during the next iteration of
\fBsl_collect\fP.  Important: this function simply redirects the
\fIslconn->info\fP pointer to the \fIinfostr\fP pointer; this means
that the content of the string pointed to by \fIinfostr\fP must not be
destroyed or changed until the INFO request has been sent.

Only one request can be "queued up" at a time, \fBsl_request_info\fP
will complain if it is used while a previous request is still waiting
to be sent.  The \fIslconn->info\fP pointer will be NULL if no
requests are pending.

.SH RETURN VALUES
Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.

.SH EXAMPLE
See \fBsl_collect\fP(3) for an example.
