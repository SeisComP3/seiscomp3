.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsl_log\fP functions are the central logging facility for
all output from libslink functions.  They are also intended to be used
by client programs.  If \fIverbosity\fP is equal to or greater than
the currently set verbosity level the message will be processed,
otherwise not.

Three message levels are recognized:
 0  : Normal log messgaes, printed using log_print with logprefix
 1  : Diagnostic messages, printed using diag_print with logprefix
 2+ : Error messages, printed using diag_print with errprefix

It is the task of the \fBsl_log\fP functions to format a message using
\fBprintf\fP conventions and pass the formatted string to the
appropriate printing function (\fIlog_print\fP or \fIdiag_print\fP)

\fBsl_log\fP will process messages using the global logging
parameters.

\fBsl_log_r\fP is a reentrant version of \fBsl_log\fP.  It will use
the logging parameters specified in the SLCD.  Global logging
parameters will be used if the parameters in the SLCD have not been
initialized.  This is intended for use in threaded programs where it
is desirable that each thread has it's own logging scheme.

\fBsl_log_rl\fP is a reentrant version of \fBsl_log\fP.  It will use
the logging parameters specified in the supplied SLlog struct.  If
\fBlog\fP is NULL global parameters will be used, this would be
equivalent to a call to sl_log().  This is intended for use only when
complicated logging schemes are desired.

The \fBsl_loginit\fP functions are used to set the logging
\fIverbosity\fP, the log and error printing functions and the log and
error message prefixes used by the \fBsl_log\fP functions.

\fBsl_loginit\fP will operate on the global logging parameters.

\fBsl_loginit_r\fP is a reentrant version of \fBsl_loginit\fP.  It
will initialize or change the logging parameters specified in the
SLCD.  If no logging parameters have been previously specified space
for them will be allocated and the SLCD will be updated.  This is
intended for use in threaded programs where it is desirable that each
thread has it's own logging scheme.

\fBsl_loginit_rl\fP is a reentrant version of \fBsl_loginit\fP.  It
will initialize or change the logging parameters specified in the
SLlog struct.  If \fIlog\fP is NULL a new SLlog struct will be
allocated.  A pointer to the created or re-initialized SLlog struct
will be returned.  The returned pointer is suitable for use with
\fBsl_log_rl\fP.

Use NULL for the print function pointers or the prefixes if they
should not be changed from previously set or default values.

The default values for the logging parameters are:
  verbosity  = 0        (basic messages)
  log_print  = fprintf  (printing to standard out)
  log_prefix = ""
  diag_print = fprintf  (printing to standard error)
  err_prefix = "error: "

By setting the printing functions it is possible to re-direct all of
the output from \fBsl_log\fP.  This is useful when the SeedLink client
is embedded in a system with it's own logging facilities.

It is also possible to suppress all output from libslink functions by
setting the verbosity to a negative number.

Most of the libslink internal messages are logged at either the
diagnostic or error level.

.SH RETURN VALUES
\fBsl_log\fP, \fBsl_log_r\fP and \fBsl_log_rl\fP return the number of
characters formatted on success, and a negative value on error.

\fBsl_loginit_rl\fP returns a pointer to the SLlog struct that it
operated on.  If the input SLlog struct is NULL a new struct will be
allocated with \fBmalloc()\bP.

.SH EXAMPLE
Unless a complicated logging scheme is needed most uses of this
logging facility will be limited to the sl_loginit and sl_log
functions.

A simple example of setting the default verbosity:

.nf
#include <libslink.h>
 
main () {
  int verbosity;

  ... get desired verbosity from command line, etc. 

  sl_loginit (verbose, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

  /* Normal log message, will be printed to stdout */
  sl_log (0, 0, "Verbosity level is: %d", verbosity);

  /* Diagnostic message, will be printed to stderr */
  sl_log (1, 0, "Verbosity level is: %d", verbosity);

  /* Error message, will be prefixed with "error: " and printed to stderr */
  sl_log (2, 0, "Verbosity level is: %d", verbosity);
}
.fi

A more complicated example of setting the printing functions:

.nf
#include <libslink.h>

void log_print (const char *message);
void diag_print (const char *message);

main () {
  int verbosity;

  ... get desired verbosity from command line, etc. 

  sl_loginit (verbose, &log_print, "LOG: ", &diag_print, "ERR: ");

  /* Normal log message, "LOG: " will be prefixed */
  sl_log (0, 0, "Verbosity level is: %d", verbosity);

  /* Diognostic message, "LOG: " will be prefixed */
  sl_log (1, 0, "Verbosity level is: %d", verbosity);

  /* Error message, "ERR: " will be prefixed */
  sl_log (2, 0, "Verbosity level is: %d", verbosity);
}

void log_print (const char *message) {
  /* Send message to external log message facility */
  send_log(message);
}

void diag_print (const char *message) {
  /* Send message to external error message facility */
  send_error(message);
}
.fi
