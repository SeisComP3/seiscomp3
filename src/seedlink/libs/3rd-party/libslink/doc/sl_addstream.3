.SH NAME
sl_addstream, sl_setuniparams \- populate stream chain or set
parameters for uni-station mode

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <libslink.h>
.sp
.BI "int \fBsl_addstream\fP (SLCD *" slconn ", char *" net ", char *" sta ",
.BI "                  char *" selectors ", int " seqnum ", char *" timestamp );
.sp
.BI "int \fBsl_setuniparams\fP (SLCD *" slconn ", char *" selectors ", int " seqnum ",
.BI "                     char *" timestamp );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsl_addstream\fP adds an entry to the stream chain for the SeedLink
Connection Description specified in \fIslconn\fP.  This function
implies multi-station mode and will set the multistation flag in the
SLCD to true.  The helper functions \fBsl_read_streamlist\fP and
\fBsl_parse_streamlist\fP use this function to add entries to the
stream chain.  No checking is done for duplicate streams entries.

\fBsl_setuniparams\fP sets the parameters for uni-station collection
mode, essentially a stream chain of one entry.  The multistation flag
in the SLCD is set to false.  If uni-station mode is desired this
function should be used even though the sequence number or time stamp
is unknown as it adds the needed single entry to the stream chain.

If no \fIselectors\fP are to be used for the given entry the value
should be 0.  If no \fIseqnum\fP (sequence number) is given it should
be -1.  If no \fItimestamp\fP is given it should be 0.

.SH RETURN VALUES
On success these functions return 0, on error -1.

.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
#include <libslink.h>
 
main () {
  SLCD * slconn;
 
  ...

  sl_addstream (slconn, "GE", "APE", 0, -1, 0);
   or
  sl_setuniparams (slconn, 0, -1, 0);

  return
}
.fi

.SH NOTES
If multi-station mode is desired the \fBsl_parse_streamlist\fP and
\fBsl_read_streamlist\fP functions should be evaluated for use as they
simpify the population of the stream chain.

Although it is possible to set the sequence numbers and time stamps
for each stream entry with these functions it is much easier to use
\fBsl_recoverstate\fP to fill in these entries from a state file.
