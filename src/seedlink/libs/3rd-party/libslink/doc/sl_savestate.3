.TH SL_SAVESTATE 3 2003/11/03
.SH NAME
sl_savestate, sl_recoverstate \- Save and recover connection state information

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <libslink.h>
.sp
.BI "int \fBsl_savestate\fP (SLCD *" slconn ", char *" statefile ");
.sp
.BI "int \fBsl_recoverstate\fP (SLCD *" slconn ", char *" statefile ");
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsl_savestate\fP saves the sequence numbers and time stamps for each
entry in the stream chain associated with \fIslconn\fP to a file
\fIstatefile\fP.  Any existing file is overwritten.  The file is
created if necessary.

\fBsl_recoverstate\fP recovers sequence numbers and time stamps from a
file \fIstatefile\fP and inserts them into the appropriate entries of
the stream chain associated with \fIslconn\fP.

Using these two functions a SeedLink client program can be re-started
without loss of continuous data.

.SH RETURN VALUES
These functions return 0 on success and -1 on error.
\fBsl_recoverstate\fP will return 1 if the specified file could not be
found.

.SH NOTES
The \fBsl_collect\fP function will automatically keep updated sequence
numbers and time stamps for the last packet received for each stream.
If, for some crazy reason, the client program is not using
\fBsl_collect\fP and the values in the stream chain are not otherwise
maintained these functions will not do you much good.

It is highly recommended to implement signal handling to properly
handle the shutdown of the client program which might include the
saving of state information.
