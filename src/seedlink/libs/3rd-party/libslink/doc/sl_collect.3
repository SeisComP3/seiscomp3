.SH DESCRIPTION
Using the parameters in a SeedLink Connection Description (SLCD)
\fBsl_collect\fP will persistantly maintain a connection to SeedLink
server.  Designed to run in a tight loop at the heart of a client
program, this function blocks until a packet is received.  When a 
packet is received \fIslpack\fP is set to the packet address and a
positive integer is returned.  Based on the \fIkeepalive\fP,
\fInetto\fP and \fInetdly\fP parameters in the SLCD, the function will
send keep alive packets and reconnect when necessary.  When the 
\fIterminate\fP flag is set in the SLCD \fBsl_collect\fP will close
the network connection, finish passing received packets to the calling
program and finally return NULL when the buffer is empty.

\fBsl_collect\fP will maintain the sequence number and start time of
the last received packet for each stream in the stream chain.  This
is useful in conjuntion with the \fBsl_savestate\fP and
\fBsl_recoverstate\fP functions.

\fBsl_collect_nb\fP is a non-blocking version of \fBsl_collect\fP.  It
will always return whether a packet is received or not.  If not called
regularly this function might not be able to properly manage the
connection, i.e. update internal timers, send keepalives, etc.  For
this reason this is NOT A RECOMMENDED INTERFACE.

The library will parse the SLCD->sladdr parameter (the SeedLink server
address in 'host:port' format) in the following way: if the host is
omitted 'localhost' will be assumed, if the port is omitted '18000'
will be assumed, if both are omitted 'localhost:18000' will be asumed.
Example translations when defaults are used:
.nf
  '<host>:' => '<host>:18000'
  ':<port>' => 'localhost:<port>'
  ':'       => 'localhost:18000'
.fi

\fBsl_terminate\fP will set the \fIterminate\fP flag in the SLCD
causing \fBsl_collect\fP to terminate the connection and flush the
packet buffer during subsequent calls.  This function should be called
during program termination, for example in a signal handler.

.SH RETURN VALUES
When a packet is received \fBsl_collect\fP returns SLPACKET and
updates the \fIslpack\fP pointer.  When the connection was closed by
the server or the termination sequence is completed SLTERMINATE is
returned and the \fIslpack\fP pointer will be NULL.

\fBsl_collect_nb\fP behaves just like \fBsl_collect\fP with the
exception that it will return SLNOPACKET when no packets are
available; in this case the \fIslpack\fP pointer will be NULL.

.SH SeedLink PACKETS
A SeedLink packet is simply a SeedLink header followed by a Mini-SEED
record; defined in libslink.h as a C struct (and type):

.nf
typedef struct slpacket_s
{
  char      slhead[SLHEADSIZE];   /* SeedLink header */
  char      msrecord[SLRECSIZE];  /* Mini-SEED record */
} SLpacket;
.fi

\fIslhead\fP is the SeedLink header (signature and sequence number).

\fImsrecord\fP is the raw Mini-SEED record.

The \fBsl_sequence\fP and \fBsl_packettype\fP routines can be used to
determine the packet sequence number and type respectively.

.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
#include <libslink.h>

void packet_handler (char *, int, int, int);

main () {
  SLCD     * slconn;
  SLpacket * slpack;
  int ptype;
  int seqnum;

  [configure the SLCD]

  while ( sl_collect(slconn, &slpack) != 0 )
    {
	ptype  = sl_packettype (slpack);
	seqnum = sl_sequence (slpack);

        packet_handler ((char *) &slpack->msrecord, ptype, seqnum, SLRECSIZE);

        /* Could send an INFO packet here with sl_request_info() */
        if ( some criteria )
          {
             sl_request_info (slconn, "ID", 0);
          }
    }

  return 0;
}

packet_handler (char *msrecord, int packet_type,
                int seqnum, int packet_size) {
  [do something with the record]
}
.fi

.SH NOTES
It is highly recommended to implement signal handling to properly
shutdown the client using \fBsl_terminate\fP.
