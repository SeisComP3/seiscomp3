.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsl_msr_new\fP and \fBsl_msr_free\fP can be used to allocate and free the
Mini-SEED structures used by \fBsl_msr_parse\fP and \fBsl_msr_print\fP.

The SLMSrecord typedef and struct is defined as:

.nf
typedef struct SLMSrecord_s {
  char                  *msrecord;    /* Pointer to original record */
  struct sl_fsdh_s       fsdh;        /* Fixed Section of Data Header */
  struct sl_blkt_100_s  *Blkt100;     /* Blockette 100, if present */
  struct sl_blkt_1000_s *Blkt1000;    /* Blockette 1000, if present */
  struct sl_blkt_1001_s *Blkt1001;    /* Blockette 1001, if present */
  int32_t               *datasamples; /* Unpacked 32-bit data samples */
  int32_t                numsamples;  /* Number of unpacked samples */
  int8_t                 unpackerr;   /* Unpacking error flag */
} SLMSrecord;
.fi

The substructures, FSDH and Blockettes, are defined in libslink.h

\fBsl_msr_free\fP will free all memory associate with a SLMSrecord
struct except for the original data record (msrecord).

\fBsl_msr_parse\fP will parse the Mini-SEED record at \fImsrecord\fP
into the above structure, swapping all numerical values into the host
byte order when appropriate.  If no SLMSrecord has been allocated yet
(i.e. *\fImsr\fP == NULL), \fBsl_msr_new\fP will be called.  Any
values in the SLMSrecord, including the data samples, are destroyed by
subsequent calls to this function.  The character arrays in the Fixed
Section Data Header will NOT be null terminated strings after parsing,
see CAVEATS below.  Log messages will be based on the logging
parameters specified in \fIlog\fP.  Often \fIlog\fP is specified as
the log parameters in an associated SLCD.  If \fIlog\fP is NULL global
logging parameters will be used

If \fIblktflag\fP is true \fBsl_msr_parse\fP will also parse any
blockettes present.  Blockettes 100, 1000 and 1001 are recognized and
parsed into structures pointed to by Blkt100, Blkt1000 and Blkt1001.
If these blockettes are not parsed the respective pointers are NULL.

If \fIunpackflag\fP is true \fBsl_msr_parse\fP will also unpack any
waveform data present.  Currently the following encoding formats are
recognized: INT-16, INT-32, Steim-1 and Steim-2.  The resulting 32-bit
data samples will be available through the \fIdatasamples\fP pointer
in the same byte order as the host. \fInumsamples\fP will be set to
the actual number of data samples unpacked; it is possible that this
value differs from the number of samples indicated in the record
header.  If errors are encountered during unpacking/decompression the
\fIunpackerr\fP flag will be set appropriately, for no errors it will
be set to MSD_NOERROR (with a value of 0), see UNPACKING ERRORS below.
If the waveform data is not unpacked then the pointer will be NULL and
\fInumsamples\fP will be -1.

\fBsl_msr_print\fP will print the header/blockette information in the
given SLMSrecord at the log level (0) using the logging parameters
specified in \fIlog\fP.  Unless the logging system messages have been
redirected this means that this information will be printed to
standard output.  Often \fIlog\fP is specified as the log parameters
in an associated SLCD.  If \fIlog\fP is NULL global logging parameters
will be used.  If the \fIdetails\fP flag is greater than zero detailed
information (values in the fixed header and following blockettes) is
printed.  Otherwise only a single line for each packet is printed.

\fBsl_msr_srcname\fP will generate a source name string of the format
"Net_Sta_Loc_Chan[_Qual]" for the given SLMSrecord.  The data quality
indicator will be added to the source name if the \fIquality\fP flag
is true.  The supplied \fIsrcname\fP buffer must have enough room to
hold the result.

\fBsl_msr_dsamprate\fP, \fBsl_msr_dnomsamprate\fP and
\fBsl_msr_depochstime\fP are helper functions for common, mundane
calculations.  \fBsl_msr_dsamprate\fP sets \fIsamprate\fP to either
the actual sample rate (field 3 of Blockette 100), if it is included
and parsed, or the nominal sample rate calculated from the sample rate
factor and multiplier in the fixed section data header.
\fBsl_msr_dnomsamprate\fP always returns the nominal sample rate.
\fBsl_msr_depochstime\fP returns the start time of the record as a
double precision Unix/POSIX epoch (seconds since January 1, 1970)
including the microseconds offset in Blockette 1001 if included.

.SH RETURN VALUES
\fBsl_msr_new\fP returns a pointer to the newly allocated SLMSrecord
struct or NULL on error.

\fBsl_msr_parse\fP returns the pointer to the SLMSrecord struct on
success.  On error *ppmsr is set to NULL and NULL is returned.

\fBsl_msr_print\fP returns non-zero on success and 0 on error.

\fBsl_msr_dsamprate\fP returns 1 if \fIsamprate\fP is the actual
sample rate, 2 if it is the nominal sample rate or 0 on error.

\fBsl_msr_depochstime\fP returns a large positive double on success
and 0 on error.

.SH UNPACKING ERRORS
If the \fIunpackflag\fP is true when calling \fBsl_msr_parse\fP the
\fIunpackerr\fP flag will be set to one of the following:

.IP MSD_NOERROR
No errors, value is 0
.IP MSD_UNKNOWNFORMAT
Unknown data format
.IP MSD_SAMPMISMATCH
The number of samples in the header did not match the number unpacked/decompressed
.IP MSD_BADSAMPCOUNT
The number of samples indicated in the header is bad, negative?
.IP MSD_STBADLASTMATCH
Steim data integrity check failed, last sample does not match
.IP MSD_STBADCOMPFLAG
A bad Steim compression flag was encountered

.SH CAVEATS
The character arrays in the Fixed Section Data Header
(sequence_number, station, location, channel and network) will NOT be
null terminated strings after parsing.  They can easily be copied and
"cleaned" with the included \fBsl_strncpclean(3)\fP function,
resulting in well behaved C strings.
