This package contains the source code, documentation and example code
for libslink, the SeedLink client library.  For further information
regarding the library interface and usage see the documentation in the
'doc' directory, including a Users Guide and man pages.

The library should work in Linux, BSD (and derivatives like macOS),
Solaris and MS-Windows environments.

For installation instructions see the INSTALL file.  For further
information regarding the library interface see the documentation in
the 'doc' directory.  For example uses of libslink see the source code
in the 'examples' directory.

-- Extras --

The 'example' directory includes an example SeedLink client that uses
libslink.

The 'doc' directory includes all associated documentation including
a Users Guide and man pages for library functions.

-- Threading --

The library is thread-safe under Unix-like environments with the
condition that each connection descriptor (SLCD) is handled by a
single thread.  Thread independent logging schemes are possible.
Under WIN32 the library is not thread-safe.

-- Pronunciation --

lib = 'l' + [eye] + 'b'  (as in library, long 'i')
s = [es]   (like the beginning of 'esta' in como esta?)
link = link   (rhymes with the color pink)

all together: 'l' [eye] 'b' [es] link
