                libslink: the SeedLink client library

This package contains the source code, documentation and example code
for libslink, the SeedLink client library.  For further information
regarding the library interface and usage see the documentation in the
'doc' directory, including a Users Guide and man pages.

Installation instructions for libslink: the SeedLink client library.

-- Building --

Linux/Unix: The easiest way to compile the library is to simply run
'make'.  The included Makefile should work for most Unix-like
environments; a special target of 'gcc' will explicitly use gcc with
'-02' optimization and more warnings.  By default a statically linked
version of the library is built 'libslink.a'.  Using gcc it is
possible to build a shared library with 'make shared'.

Mac OSX (Darwin): A static library can be compiled using the above
Linux/Unix instructions, just run 'make'.  A dynamic library can be
built with 'make dynamic'.

Windows: On a WIN32 platform the library can be compiled by using the
Nmake compatible Makefile.win (e.g. 'nmake -f Makefile.win') or Open
Watcom's Wmake with Makefile.wat (e.g. 'wmake -f Makefile.wat'). The
default target is a static library 'libslink.lib'.  The library has
been tested with Microsoft Visual Studio 6 and Open Watcom 1.1.

For non-WIN32 platforms the POSIX nanosleep() function is used.  This
function may not be implemented on older Solaris or Linux platforms.
It is known to be available under Solaris 8 or later and recent
versions of Glibc2.

-- Installing --

For installation into the system development environment simply copy
the library (libslink.a, libslink.so* and/or libslink.*.dylib) into a
system library directory and copy the associated header file
(libslink.h) into a system include directory.  Otherwise the library
and include file can be used directly from the build directory.

-- Extras --

The 'example' directory includes an example SeedLink client that uses
libslink.

The 'doc' directory includes all associated documentation including
a Users Guide and man pages for library functions.

-- Threading --

The library is thread-safe under Unix-like environments with the
condition that each connection descriptor (SLCD) is handled by a
single thread.  Thread independent logging schemes are possible.
Under WIN32 the library is not thread-safe.

-- Pronunciation --

lib = 'l' + [eye] + 'b'  (as in library, long 'i')
s = [es]   (like the beginning of 'esta' in como esta?)
link = link   (rhymes with the color pink)

all together: 'l' [eye] 'b' [es] link
