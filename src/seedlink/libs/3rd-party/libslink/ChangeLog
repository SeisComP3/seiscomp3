2009.240/AH: version 2.2b-sc3
	- Batchmode support.

2009.050: version 2.2b.
	- Add an include for sys/stat.h for Solaris in slplatform.h.

2008.078: version 2.2
	- Use io.h header instead of unistd.h on Win32.

2008.028: version 2.1
	- Convert all buffered IO file operations to unbuffered IO routines.
	- Add sl_readline() to genutils.c to read and return a line, defined
	by newline characters, from unbuffered IO, i.e. a file descriptor.
	- Add slp_openfile() to slplatform.[ch] to portably open files.
	- Change Makefile and src/Makefile to use user defined CC and CFLAGS.
	
2007.284: version 2.0 (no version change)
	- Use memchr() instead of strnstr() in network.c for portability.
	- Add globmatch.obj to Makefile.wat and Makefile.win.

2007.282: version 2.0
	- Add parsing of capability flags included with the server
	version string which is now expected to be in the format:
	"SeedLink v#.# <optional text> <:: capability flags>".
	Currently recognized capability flags:
	  SLPROTO:#.# == SeedLink protocol version
	  CAP == Supports CAPABILITY command
          EXTREPLY == Extended reply messages supported
          NSWILDCARD == Network & station code wildcarding
	- Add sending of CAPABILITY command after HELLO in say_hello()
	if the server supports the CAPABILITY command.
	- Add ability to recognize extended replies from the server,
	these are in the form of "Reply\rExtended Message\r\n", for
	example: "ERROR\rSTATION command requires 1 or 2 arguments\r\n".

2007.179:
	- Add globmatch.[ch], includes a function to do glob matching.
	- Use glob matching in update_stream() when updating sequence
	numbers of packet streams received.  This is needed to facilitate
	the '*' and '?' wildcards in network and station codes.
	- Change update_stream() to update all the entries in the stream
	chain that match the given network and station code.  This allows
	the situation where data from a given network-station pair is
	selected in two or more selectors to work properly with state files.

2006.354: version 1.7
	- No functionality changes since 1.6; only function, macro and 
	struct name changes to avoid collisions with other libraries.

2006.344: version 1.7rc2
	- Add "sl_" prefix to sl_strparse, sl_strncpclean and sl_gswap
	functions.
	- Add "SL" prefix to SLstrlist typedef and SL_SWAPBTIME macro.
	No functionality changes, symbol renaming only.

2006.336: version 1.7rc1
	- Add "sl_" prefix to SEED structures to avoid collision,
	changed structs: sl_blkt_head_s, sl_btime_s, sl_blkt_100_s,
	sl_blkt_1000_s, sl_blkt_1001_s, sl_fsdh_s.
	- Add "sl_" prefix to the following routines to avoid
	collision with libmseed functions: sl_msr_new, sl_msr_free,
	sl_msr_parse, sl_msr_print, sl_msr_dsamprate,
	sl_msr_dnomsamprate, sl_msr_depochstime.
	- Add "SL" to the record structure and typedef which are
	now: struct SLMSrecord_s, typedef SLMSrecord.
	No functionality changes, symbol renaming only.

2006.028: version 1.6
	- No changes, only update version.

2005.342: version 1.6rc1
	- Test for NULL pointers int logging.c routines and handle
	them as best as possible.
	- Add 'b' to the mode of all fopen() calls; WIN32 then does
	not try to translate line endings.
	- Add createlinks.sh in doc directory to re-create symbolic
	links after CVS checkout.

2005.103: version 1.5
	- Fixup some in-line comments.
	- Add an SLP_PACKED defined to __attribute__ ((packed))
	to slplatform.h when using the GCC compiler.
	- Use the SLP_PACKED attribute where needed for portability
	to the XScale (ARM) architecture.  Thanks Andres.

2005.097: version 1.5pre2
	- Modify sl_addstream() to NOT check for duplicate streams.
	- Change Makefile and example/Makefile to include specific
	targets for 'gcc'.  By default $CC is used with the '-O' flag.

2005.089: version 1.5pre1
	- Add msr_dnomsamprate() to calculate the nominal sampling
	rate for an MSrecord, use it in msr_dsamprate().
	- Include calculated sample rate in Hz in msr_print() output.
	- Support for microsecond precision in record start time,
	including msr_print() and msr_depochstime().
	- 'host:port' parsing extended to include possibility of a single
	colon translating to 'localhost:18000'.  The parsing is now:
	  ':'       => 'localhost:18000'
	  '<host>'  => '<host>:18000'
	  ':<port>' => 'localhost:<port>'
	- Better checking for termination during connection opening and 
	negotiation, termination should occur without timeout experation.
	- Use gswap routines instead of tswap routines.

2004.222: version 1.4
	- sl_connect will set the SLCD->terminate flag if a permanent
	error (invalid port specified) was detected.  This way the 
	sl_collect routines will not re-connect endlessly.
	- String termination bug fixed in the new sladdr parsing.
	- Remove sleep call in sl_collect().
	- Update the slclient example program.

2004.219:
	- Add sl_ping which connects to server, issues HELLO, receives
	response lines and disconnects.
	- sl_connect now does it's own parsing of the sladdr string and 
	fills in default hostname *and* port (localhost and 18000).
	- sl_connect now takes one more argument (int sayhello) which 
	controls whether sl_sayhello is called after making the connection.
	
2004.196: version 1.3
	- Add a new class of log level for a total of three levels:
	0  : Normal log messages, defaulting to stdout with logprefix
	1  : Diagnostic messages, defaulting to stderr with logprefix
	2+ : Error messages, defaulting to stderr with errprefix
	- Go through library and change most log output to the diagnostic
	level, meaning most output will go to stderr with the exception 
	of the msr_print() output which is logged at the 0 level.
 
2004.174:
	- sl_log_main: use fprintf instead of printf and change default
	desitination for error messages to stderr.  Log messages still go
	to stdout.
	- Change SLCD->server_version to SLCD->protocol_ver to better
	reflect what that value is or at least supposed to be.
	- Update Windows Makefile's for the previous source file renaming
	changes.

2004.170: version 1.2a
	- sl_recvresp: cast buffer to type (char *) so pointer arithmetic
	will work under compilers that do not assume void* is char size
	(e.g. Sun cc).

2004.168: version 1.2
	- sl_collect[_nb]: process data in receive buffer even if connection
	is not in SL_DATA state, this means the buffer will be emptied even
	when the connection is not up.
	- sl_collect[_nb]: reset keepalive_trig after successfully
	connecting so a keepalive will not be sent directly after a
	re-connection.
	- sl_collect[_nb]: update timing variables every time unless data
	is received, termination is triggered or other early exit
	conditions appear; previously this was only done when more than a
	1/4 second had elapsed.
	- libslink.h: remove the previous_time element from the SLstat
	type.
	- sl_collect: handle a failure of select() more elegantly by
	resetting the connection.
	- sl_collect: change strerror() to slp_strerror() for any errors
	with select() so the error will be correct under Win32.
	- msr_parse: free allocated MSrecord and set *ppmsr to NULL on
	errors in addition to returning NULL.
	- Change some boolean values to type int8_t.
	
2004.166:
	- Correctly reset sendpacket flag in sl_collect[_nb].  Previously
	it might have been possible that data packets would be skipped if
	heartbeats were received while receiving a high rate of data
	packets.  This behaviour was never reported with this codebase;
        nevertheless it might be possible to exercise this bug with
	particularly written client code.  Thanks Anthony Lomax.
	- Changed the sendpacket and terminator variables in
	sl_collect[_nb] to type int8_t as they're only boolean values.
	- Rename sendpacket to retpacket in sl_collect[_nb] for clarity.
	- Rename source file slutils.c->genutils.c and main.c->slutils.c

2004.142:
        - Do not send terminating NULL characters in command strings sent
        to the server.  The protocol stipulates that commands must be
        terminated with a carriage return (\r) followed by an optional
        new line (\n).  The library now strictly terminates commands 
        with only a carriage return.  Thanks Ernesto Del Prete.
        - Add sl_recvresp() to robustly receive responses from the server
        that are terminated with '\r\n'.  This should improve usage when
        the server responds slowly or with longer responses to commands.
        - Use sl_recvresp() in say_hello() to get the two response lines
        and report them both.
        - Change argument 'code' to 'ident' in sl_*data() routines.
	
2004.131:
	- Removed space from 'error sending' message in sl_senddata().
	- Add define for LIBSLINK_RELEASE with the date of release,
	e.g. "2004.131".

2004.125: version 1.1
	- Make parsing of server version more generic and robust with
	a patch from Andres.  The server response to HELLO is expected
	to be in the format 'seedlink v#.# <optional text>', if it's
	not the server_version is set to 0.0 and the library will not
	check the server version when using advanced protocol features.

2004.118:
	- Port and test under Mac OS X (Darwin) and add SLP_DARWIN define.
	- sl_request_info(): Print INFO request type when request is
	denied due to a pending request.
	- Update Makefile usage of ar to include the -s flag, this
	was needed under Darwin to build an index into the static
	library and is a good idea anyway.
	- Update Makefile to create symbolic links when shared/dynamic
	libraries are built.
	- Consolidate INSTALL and README files into just README.
	
2003.309: version 1.0 (Yay!)
	- Add a missing include for Solaris.

2003.307: version 1.0pre1
	- Change slp_getaddrinfo() to use the reentrant gethostbyname_r()
	under glibc2 and Solaris.  getaddrinfo() is only supported under
	Solaris 8 and later, and early glibc2 does strange things.
	- In slplatform.h define SLP_GLIBC2, SLP_SOLARIS or SLP_WIN32
	based on the architecture.
	- Add a Makefile.wat (also for the example) for Open Watcom's
	wmake utility.
	- Documentation updates.
	
2003.280: version 0.9.6
	- Add two new functions sl_log_rl() and sl_loginit_rl(); these are
	versions of the logging facility that work directly on a SLlog
	struct.  If no SLlog is given to sl_log_rl() it will use the
	global logging parameters.  If no SLlog is given to
	sl_loginit_rt() it will allocated space before initializing the
	parameters.
	- Update msr_parse() and msr_print() to take an SLlog
	(instead of an SLCD) for logging parameters and use the new
	sl_log_rl() internally.
	- Change the verbosity level of two messages as suggested by
	Andres.

2003.276: version 0.9.5a
	- Add two new functions sl_log_r() and sl_loginit_r(); these are
	reentrant versions of the previous functions.  Intended for use
	in threaded programs where the each thread can use it's own 
	logging scheme.
	- Updated most of the library logging to use sl_log_r with the
	appropriate SLCD, this required a small bit of re-arrangement
	including a change to the arguments for msr_parse() and 
	msr_print() which now need a SLCD.
	
2003.274: version 0.9.4
	- Create slp_getaddrinfo(), this will use gethostbyname() on
	Win32 and getaddrinfo() on others.  getaddrinfo is only
	supported in very recent Win32 platforms.
	- A few other tweaks for compiling under Win32.

2003.273: version 0.9.3
	Making things thread safe/friendly:
	- Make a new SLstat struct to hold all persistent (static) state
	variables used in sl_collect[_nb]().  Added a pointer to one of
	these in the SLCD.  Also updated sl_newslcd() and sl_freeslcd()
	to support this.
	- Use getaddrinfo() instead of gethostbyname() in sl_connect().
	- Change update_stream() to extract FSDH information without
	using msr_parse().  Both faster and thread safe.
	- Change encoding_hash() to be reentrant and modify msr_print()
	to use it.

2003.272: version 0.9.2
	- Fix bug in slp_usleep().
	- Minor changes to strtoul() usage in sl_connect().
	- Add -lrt to the Solaris LDLIBS to get nanosleep().

2003.262: version 0.9.1
	- New portability function slp_usleep() sleeps for given micro
	seconds.  Uses SleepEx under Win32 and nanosleep() for others.
	- Update sl_collect() and sl_collect_nb() to always return
	SLPACKET, SLTERMINATE or SLNOPACKET.
	- Reset some verbosity flags for uni-sta. negotiation, now
	it's like multi-sta. negotiation.
	- Update to example/slclient.c, standard flag usage.
	
2003.237: 
	- Change Makefile to use GCC by default and use -O2 optimization.
	- Fix some variable initializations.
	- Minor cleanups, move MAX_LOG_MSG_LENGTH to libslink.h.

2003.182: version 0.9
	- Move sl_sequence and sl_packettype into main.c from slutils.c.
	- Move doy2md() from main.c to sl_doy2md() in slutils.c and
	"export" it (i.e. declare it in libslink.h).
	- Add sl_doy2md() and strncpclean() to utils man page.
	- Remove barely used constants from libslink.h.

2003.181: version 0.8.4
	- Use only a single error indicator for bad Steim compression
	flags regardless of compression level.  If the caller needs
	to know the level it is in the FSDH.
	- Rename the MSrecord element from unpackflag to unpackerr to
	avoid confusion with the argument to msr_parse().
	- Update the documentation to describe the new unpackerr flag.
	- Update a few non-standard func. declarations in slplatform.h
	
2003.177: version 0.8.2
	- Rename the MSheader struct to MSrecord to reflect the fact
	that the mini-system processes more than just the header.
	- Add an element to the MSrecord struct, 'unpackflag' that
	will be set by the unpacking routines to indicates errors.
	- Rename all the MSrecord related functions, now they are
	prefixed with 'msr_' for clarify/uniformity.
	- Change RECSIZE declaration in libslink.h to SLRECSIZE.
	- Remove unneeded main loop in sl_collect_nb(), it never loops.

2003.174:
	- Change char *'s to const char *'s in save/recover state
	routines (patch from Andres).

2003.169: version 0.8
	- Minor updates to Makefile.win.
	- Change requested Windows Sockets version to 2.2.

2003.168: 
	- Include a man page for sl_dtime().
	- Many more small changes for portability to WIN32.
	- Include an Nmake compatible Makefile.win for building on WIN32.
	- Update the slclient.c example and include a Makefile.win to
	build it on a WIN32 platform.

2003.167:
	- Change sl_readdata() and sl_writedata() to sl_recvdata() and
	sl_senddata() respectively.  These new functions use the recv()
	and send() system calls for network socket operation; they 
	are much more portable than read/write.
	- Create slplatform.c to hold portable functions, basically 
	these are functions to provide a common interface to differing
	system implementations.
	- Rename slstdint.h to slplatform.h and use it for including
	platform specific headers.
	
2003.163: version 0.7.2
	- Include and use a slstdint.h header file to help deal with
	portability of the standard integer types.  It's a bit sparse
	right now.
	- Add 'resume' flag to the SLCD to control the usage of sequence
	numbers with DATA/FETCH commands.  Default is true.
	- Change char *'s in logging routines to const char *'s.
	- Change default use of lastpkttime to false in new_slcd().
	
2003.162: version 0.7.1
	- Change host_latency(), to use the new helper functions.
	- Add helper functions double_samprate() and depoch_starttime() to
	msheader.c
	- Change msrecord pointer (MSheader struct) to a const char pointer
	- Change argument for print_MSheader() from 'header' to 'msheader'
	for consistency with related functions.
	- Change sl_log() calls in print_MSheader() to use a verbosity
	level of 0 instead of 1.  If print_MSheader() is called the ouput
	should be printed, period (the only exception is when the logging
	verbosity is less than 0).
	
2003.157: version 0.7
	- Changed the declaration of sl_collect().  Now a pointer to a
	pointer for an SLpacket is passed, when a packet is received
	this pointer is updated.  sl_collect() now returns an integer
	giving more possibilities for return values.  When a packet is
	received SLPACKET is returned (a positive integer), when an error
	or termination is occurs 0 is returned.
	- Added a non-blocking version of sl_collect() called, creatively,
	sl_collect_nb().  This acts the same as sl_collect() but, instead
	of blocking, will return SLNOPACKET (defined in libslink.h) when
	no data is available.  This routine is considered experimental
	and not documented.

2003.156:
	- Add 'terminate' flag to the SLCD and include a sl_terminate()
	function to set it.  Modify sl_connect() to close the connection,
	send remaining packets in buffer and finish with a NULL when
	this flag is set.  Also modified the example client to use this
	new shutdown technique.	
	- Add 'lastpkttime' flag to the SLCD to indicate if the last
	packet time should be appended to the FETCH/DATA command during
	negotiation.  Default is 1 (true).
	- Add 'numsamples' element to the MSheader data type to indicate
	the actual number of data samples unpacked.  If no unpacking
	is requested this is set to -1.
	- Declare unpack_* routines in unpack.c as static to avoid
	function name collision.
	- Use the 'const' qualifier for char and SLCD types when no
	modification is done.
	- Standardize sl_freeslcd() function name.
	
2003.083: version 0.6
	- Fix memory leaks in parse_streamlist().

2003.073: version 0.5
	- Renaming for consistency and many cleanups.

Early 2003: version 0.1
	- Re-fit utility functions from slinktool for library usage.
	
	- Add lots of other useful functions including config (stream
	list) file reading, state file functions, Mini-SEED record parsing
	and data sample unpacking/decompressing, etc.

	- Write a short Users Guide and some man pages.
