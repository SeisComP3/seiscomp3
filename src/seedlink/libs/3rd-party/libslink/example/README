directory.

-- slclient.c --

An example SeedLink client written in C that demonstrates general
usage of libslink.  A Makefile is provided to build the client.  The
client does not exercise all of the functionality of libslink.  For a
more comprehensive example the developer is referred to the source
code for slinktool.

Solaris: to compile slclient.c the Makefile needs to be edited 
(comments are included in the Makefile).

Windows: to compile slclient.c use the Nmake compatible Makefile.win
(e.g. >nmake -f Makefile.win) or Watcom's Wmake with Makefile.wat
(e.g. >wmake -f Makefile.wat). 


-- streamlist.conf --

An example stream list that can be used with the -l argument of
slclient or with the sl_read_streamlist() function from libslink.
