.SH GENERAL ROUTINES

.nf

\f3
extern int init_qlib2
    (int	mode)
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3init_qlib2()\f1 determines how qlib2 will handle
serious errors.
Earlier versions of qlib2 library could call exit() when it
encountered a serious error.  You may now specify that
qlib2 returns all error conditions to the calling function,
and that it never calls exit().  The following list shows
valid values of mode, and what effect they have on the
qlib2 library.
.br
.nf
	0	backwards compatible - call exit() on serious error.
	1	return all error conditions to calling function.
.br
.fi
In order to be backwards compatible, if you do NOT 
call init_qlib2(), qlib2 will behave as though init_qlib2 
was called with a value of 0.

.nf
.br
\f3
extern int get_my_wordorder()
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3get_my_wordorder()\f1 will determine the wordorder of the
computer, set the external variable \f3my_wordorder\f1 to the computer's
wordorder, and return the wordorder as the function value.  If the functions
set_hdr_wordorder and set_data_wordorder have not been called to explicitly
set the desired hdr_wordorder and data_wordorder for creating MiniSEED data,
these functions will be initialized appropriately.  Depending on how qlib2
was compiled, these will either be initialized to the computer's wordorder
OR to a fixed wordorder such as SEED_BIG_ENDIAN.  This function should be
called before any other qlib2 function.  If the user does not call this function,
it will be called by the required qlib2 functions.

.nf
.br
\f3
extern int set_hdr_wordorder 
   (int		wordorder)	/* desired wordorder of MiniSEED hdr.	*/
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3set_hdr_wordorder()\f1 will set the desired wordorder for
the fixed header of created MiniSEED records to the specified wordorder.
Valid wordorders are SEED_BIG_ENDIAN or SEED_LITTLE_ENDIAN.
If this function is not called, it will be set appropriately by the function 
\f3get_my_wordorder()\f1.  It is STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to use the same wordorder
for the header and data portions of MiniSEED records.  The function returns
the specified wordorder.

.nf
.br
\f3
extern int set_data_wordorder 
   (int		wordorder)	/* desired wordorder of MiniSEED data.	*/
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3set_data_wordorder()\f1 will set the desired wordorder for
the data of created MiniSEED records to the specified wordorder.
Valid wordorders are SEED_BIG_ENDIAN or SEED_LITTLE_ENDIAN.
If this function is not called, it will be set appropriately by the function 
\f3get_my_wordorder()\f1.  It is STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to use the same wordorder
for the header and data portions of MiniSEED records.  The function returns
the specified wordorder.

.nf
.br
\f3
extern int set_record_type 
   (char	record_type)	/* desired default record_type.		*/
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3set_record_type()\f1 will set the default data record_type
in the DATA_HDR structure which is the SEED header value data_hdr_ind 
to specifies the quality level of the data record.
Valid values are:
.br
.nf
	'R'	Raw data record, or real-time data record (no QC).
	'D'	Data record, unknown quality (default).
	'Q'	QC-ed data, or higher quality.
.br
.fi
If the specified value is invalid, it will not be used.
The function returns the new record_type value.
The default value for record_type is 'R'.
Any DATA_HDR created by the new_data_hdr() function will have its
record_type initialized to the default record_type.
When writing MiniSEED, the DATA_HDR record_type will be used as the 
data_hdr_ind field in the MiniSEED Fixed Data Header.

.nf
.br
\f3
extern int is_data_hdr_ind 
    (char c)			/* data_hdr_ind char.			*/
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3is_data_hdr_ind()\f1 will return true (1) or
false (0) depending on whether the specified character is a valid data_hdr_ind
(or record_type) character.  
The current valid data_hdr_ind values are 'D', 'R', and 'Q'.
.br

.nf
.br
\f3
extern int is_vol_hdr_ind 
    (char c)			/* vol_hdr_ind char.			*/
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3is_vol_hdr_ind()\f1 will return true (1) or
false (0) depending on whether the specified character is a valid vol_hdr_ind
(or record_type) character.  The current valid vol_hdr_ind characater is 'V'.
.br
.ad

.SH MINISEED READ ROUTINES

.nf
.br
\f3
extern int read_ms 
   (DATA_HDR	**phdr,		/* pointer to pointer to DATA_HDR.	*/
    void	*data_buffer,	/* pointer to output data buffer.	*/
    int		max_num_points,	/* max # data points to return.		*/
    FILE	*fp);		/* FILE pointer for input file.		*/
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3read_ms\f1 will read the next MiniSEED record in the
specified file, parse the MiniSEED record header into a DATA_HDR structure,
unpack the data in the record, and return at most \fImax_num_pts\f1 in the
specified buffer.  The ptr \fI*phdr\f1 will be set to point to a malloc-ed
DATA_HDR structure that contains the pertinent information in the MiniSEED
header, and should be used as an argument to \f3free_data_hdr()\f1 when you are
finished with the DATA_HDR.  Currently STEIM1, STEIM2, INT_16, INT_24, and
INT_32 datatypes are supported.  The function returns the number of points
returned in the buffer, or a negative value on error.  If the MiniSEED
record contains more than \fImax_num_pts\f1 data values, the remaining data
points will be discarded.  

.nf
.br
\f3
extern int read_ms_record
   (DATA_HDR	**phdr,		/* pointer to pointer to DATA_HDR.	*/
    char	**pbuf,		/* ptr to buf ptr for MiniSEED record.	*/
    FILE	*fp);		/* FILE pointer for input file.		*/
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3read_ms_record\f1 will read the next MiniSEED record in the
specified file, parse the MiniSEED record header into a DATA_HDR structure,
and return the raw record in the buffer pointed to by *pbuf.  If \fI*pbuf\f1
is NULL, a buffer of sufficient size for the MiniSEED record will be
allocated for you, and \fI*pbuf\f1 will be set to the address of the
buffer.  The ptr \fI*phdr\f1 will be set to point to a malloc-ed DATA_HDR
structure that contains the pertinent information in the MiniSEED header,
and should be used as an argument to \f3free_data_hdr\f1 when you are
finished with the DATA_HDR.  The function returns the MiniSEED record size
as the function value, EOF on reaching EOF, or MS_ERROR on error.

.nf
.br
\f3
void free_data_hdr (DATA_HDR *hdr)
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3free_data_hdr\f1 is used to deallocate all space allocated 
for a DATA_HDR structure.  This function should be used instead of \f3free()\f1
since it will properly free all allocated data for blockettes as well as the
DATA_HDR structure itself.

.SH MINISEED WRITE ROUTINES

The following functions are useful for creating MiniSEED records.

.nf
.br
\f3
DATA_HDR new_data_hdr ()
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3new_data_hdr\f1 will create and initialize a new DATA_HDR
structure.  The structure elements that are filled in are:
	hdr_wordorder
	data_wordorder
based on the preferred setting set by functions
\f3get_my_wordorder\f1,
\f3set_hdr_wordorder\f1, or
\f3set_data_wordorder\f1,
\f3set_record_type\f1.
You are responsible for setting all other required values in the DATA_HDR
structure.

.nf
.br
\f3
extern int ms_pack_data
   (DATA_HDR	*hdr,		/* ptr to initial data hdr.		*/
    BS		*init_bs,	/* ptr to onetime blockettes.		*/
    int		num_samples,	/* number of data samples.		*/
    int		*data,		/* ptr to data buffer.			*/
    int		*n_blocks,	/* # MiniSEED blocks (returned).	*/
    char	**pp_ms,	/* ptr **MiniSEED (returned).		*/
    int		ms_len,		/* MiniSEED buffer len (if supplied).	*/
    char	*p_errmsg)	/* ptr to error msg buffer.		*/
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3ms_pack_data\f1 will create MiniSEED records in
a memory buffer for the specified number of data samples.  The blocksize
and MiniSEED data encoding must be specified in the \fIblksize\fR and
\fIdata_type\fR fields respectively in the DATA_HDR structure.
All other required attributes of the MiniSEED records (station, channel,
network, start_time, sample_reate, etc) must be specified in the DATA_HDR
structure.
.sp
If the ptr *pp_ms is NULL, the ms_pack_data function will allocate a buffer
of sufficient size to hold the created MiniSEED records, return
the ptr to the buffer in *pp_ms, and ignore the value of ms_len.
If the ptr *pp_ms is not NULL, it is assumed to be a buffer of size \fBms_len\fR
bytes into which the function will write the MiniSEED records.
.sp
The function sets the variable *n_blocks to contain the number of MiniSEED
records that were created The function returns the total number of initial
data samples that were packed into the MiniSEED records, which should equal
the total \fBnum_samples\fR if there was sufficient room in the MiniSEED
buffer for the required number of MiniSEED blocks.  If the function value is
less than \fBnum_samples\fR, you can output the created MiniSEED records,
adjust the DATA_HDR time value, and call the function again with an adjusted
ptr to the input data buffer and adjusted num_samples.

.SH TIME ROUTINES
All of the following time functions properly handle leapseconds provided a
leapsecond table is available on the system.  By default, the leapseconds
table is assumed to be in \f3/usr/local/lib/leapseconds\f1, but this can
be changed during compilation of qlib2.  In addition, the environment
variable \f3LEAPSECONDS\f1 can be used to explicitly set the pathname of
a leapsecond table.

.nf
.br
\f3
INT_TIME ext_to_int (EXT_TIME et)
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3ext_to_int\f1 converts an EXT_TIME structure into an INT_TIME
structure, and returns as its value the INT_TIME structure.

.nf
.br

\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3tepoch_to_int\f1 converts a double precision true epoch time
into an INT_TIME structure, and returns as its value the INT_TIME structure.

.nf
.br
\f3
double int_to_nepoch (INT_TIME it)
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3ext_to_nepoch\f1 converts an INT_TIME structure into a
nominal epoch time, and returns as its value the nominal epoch time.

.nf
.br
\f3
INT_TIME nepoch_to_int (double nepoch)
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3nepoch_to_int\f1 converts a double precision nominal epoch time
into an INT_TIME structure, and returns as its value the INT_TIME structure.

.nf
.br
\f3
void dy_to_mdy (int doy, int year, int *month, int *mday)
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3dy_to_mdy\f1 converts a day_of_year and year into a numeric month
and day_of_month value, and stores the month and day_of_month in the locations
pointed to by the final 2 arguments.

.nf
.br
\f3
int mdy_to_doy (int month, int day, int year)
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3mdy_to_doy\f1 computes the day_of_year for the specified month,
day, and year, and returns the day_of_year as the function value.

.nf
.br
\f3
INT_TIME normalize_time (INT_TIME it)
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3normalize_int\f1 will normalize an INT_TIME structure and return
the normalize structure as the function value.  A date is considered
"normalized" if all of its date fields fall within the valid ranges for the
year, seconds and fractional seconds.  If any component exceeds the the
bounds for that component (eg if the f1actional second exceeds 1 second), it
will be "normalized" by adding or subtracting the appropriate number to
bring it within range, and then adjusting the next higher field to
compenstate for the normalization.
.sp
The structure is normalized in the following order: minute, hour,
day_of_year, year, and second.  Once the second field has been normalized,
the minute, hour, day, month, and year are normalized again.  Once the date
has been normalized, the month and day_of_month are calculated for the
normalized field.
.sp
This function can be used to compute a new normalize time after values have
been added to field(s) of an INT_TIME structure.

.nf
.br
\f3
EXT_TIME normalize_ext (EXT_TIME et)
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3normalize_ext\f1 will normalize an EXT_TIME structure and return
the normalize structure as the function value.  A date is considered
"normalized" if all of its date fields fall within the valid ranges for the
year, month, day, hour, minute, and seconds and f1actional seconds.  If any
component exceeds the the bounds for that component (eg if the minute is < 0
or > 59), it will be "normalized" by adding or subtracting the appropriate
number to bring it within range, and then adjusting the next higher field to
compenstate for the normalization.
.sp
The structure is normalized in the following order: minute, hour,
day_of_year, year, and second.  Once the second field has been normalized,
the minute, hour, day, month, and year are normalized again.  Once the date
has been normalized, the month and day_of_month are calculated for the
normalized field.
.sp
This function can be used to compute a new normalize time after values have
been added to field(s) of an EXT_TIME structure.  Note that the month and
day_of_month field are never normalized, but merely recomputed after the
date has been normalized.  Therefore, NEVER change the month or day_of_month
field.

.nf
.br
\f3
INT_TIME add_time (INT_TIME it, int seconds, int usecs)
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3add_time\f1 is used to add the specified number of seconds
and usecs to an INT_TIME structure.  The resulting normalize INT_TIME
structure is returned as the function value.  The seconds and usecs may be
either positive or negative (to add or subtract time).  The seconds are
converted into usecs, the total number of usecs are added to the structure,
and the normalized resulting structure is returned.

.nf
.br
\f3
INT_TIME add_dtime (INT_TIME it, double usecs)
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3add_dtime\f1 is used to add the specified number of usecs to
an INT_TIME structure.  The resulting normalize INT_TIME structure is
returned as the function value.  The usecs may be either positive or
negative (to add or subtract time).  The usecs are added to the structure,
and the normalized resulting structure is returned.

.nf
.br
\f3
time_interval2 (int n, int rate, int rate_mult, int *second, int *usecs)
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3time_interval2\f1 computes the time interval for n points at
the specified sample_rate and sample_rate_mult (taken from the data_hdr
structure and defined by SEED).  It returns the number of seconds and usecs
for that interval in the locations pointed to by the last 2 arguments.  The
rate is positive for samples_per_second and negative for seconds_per_sample.

.nf
.br
\f3
double dsamples_in_time2 (int rate, int rate_mult, double usecs)
\f1
.fi
.br

The function \f3dsamples_in_time2\f1 computes the the number of samples that
span the specified time in usecs at the specified sample rate.  Rate and
rate_mult are taken from the DATA_HDR sample_rate and sample_rate_mult
fields respectively and are defined by SEED.  For example, at sample rate
100 (rate=100, rate_mult=1, for 100 samples per second) the span of
1,500,000 usecs (1.5 seconds) would span 100.0 samples of data.

.nf
.br
\f3
double tdiff (INT_TIME it1, INT_TIME it2)
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3tdiff\f1 computes the time difference of (it1 - it2) in usecs,
and returns the number of usecs.  It returns -DHUGE or +DHUGE if the returned
value is in danger of overflow.

.nf
.br
\f3
char *time_to_str (INT_TIME it, int fmt)
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3time_to_str\f1 generates a printable timestamp for the
specified time in one of several format.  The value of format and the 
resulting string format are summarized below:

.nf
	0	JULIAN_FMT:	yyyy.doy hh:mm:ss.ffff

.fi

.nf
.br
\f3
INT_TIME *parse_date(char *str)\
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3parse_date\f1 will parse a date string and return a
POINTER to a static INT_TIME structure with the corresponding date/time, or
a NULL pointer on error.  If the pointer is non-NULL the value pointed to by
the INT_TIME pointer should be copied before the next call to \f3parse_date.\f1

set the desired hdr_wordorder and data_wordorder for creating MiniSEED data,
these functions will be initialized appropriately.  Depending on how qlib2
was compiled, these will either be initialized to the computer's wordorder
OR to a fixed wordorder such as SEED_BIG_ENDIAN.  This function should be
called before any other qlib2 function.  If the user does not call this function,
it will be called by the required qlib2 functions.

.nf

.br
The function \f3f_set_hdr_wordorder()\f1 will set the desired wordorder for
the fixed header of created MiniSEED records to the specified wordorder.
Valid wordorders are SEED_BIG_ENDIAN or SEED_LITTLE_ENDIAN.
If this function is not called, it will be set appropriately by the function 
\f3f_get_my_wordorder()\f1.  It is STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to use the same wordorder
for the header and data portions of MiniSEED records.  The function returns
the specified wordorder.

.nf
.br
\f3
subroutine f_set_record_type
	character*(*)	idata_hdr_ind
	character*(*)	odata_hdr_ind
\f1
.fi
.br
The subroutine \f3f_set_record_type()\f1 will set the default data record
identifier (data_hdr_ind) that specifies the quality level of the data record.
Valid values are:
.br
.nf
	'R'	Raw data record, or real-time data record (no QC).
	'D'	Data record, unknown quality (default).
	'Q'	QC-ed data, or higher quality.
.br
.fi
The first argument is the desired value to use as the defautl data_hdr_ind.
If the specified value is invalid, it will not be used.
The subroutine returns the new data_hdr_ind value in the second argument.
Any DATA_HDR created by the new_data_hdr() function will have its
record_type initialized to the default record_type.
When writing MiniSEED, the DATA_HDR record_type will be used as the 
data_hdr_ind field in the MiniSEED Fixed Data Header.
The default value for record_type is 'R'.

.SH FORTRAN MINISEED READ ROUTINES

The function \f3f_read_ms\f1 requires an argument fp which is a file handle
that is returned by \f3ifopen\f1 function.  See the \f3fio\f1
routines for fortran-callable routines for C buffered and unbufferd I/O.

.nf
.br
\f3
integer function f_read_ms (hdr, data_buffer, maxpts, fp)
	record /DATA_HDR/ hdr
	integer maxpts
	integer data(maxpts)
	integer fp
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3f_read_ms\f1 will read the next MiniSEED record in the
specified file, and return at most \fImax_num_pts\f1 in the specified
buffer.  The DATA_HDR record will be filled in with all of the appropriate
information from the MiniSEED header (with the exception of any blockettes
which will not be returned).  The function returns the number of points
returned in the buffer, or a negative value on error.  If the MiniSEED
record contains more than \fImax_num_pts\f1 data values, the remaining data
points will be discarded.  

.nf
.br
\f3
integer function f_init_data_hdr (hdr)
	record /DATA_HDR/ hdr
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3f_init_data_hdr\f1 will initialize the DATA_HDR function
to the appropriate values.  Most fields will be set to zero, but the
hdr_wordorder, data_wordorder, and record_type will be set appropriately.
If you are calling this function to re-initialize a previously used DATA_HDR
structure, you should first call \f3f_delete_blockette(hdr,-1) to free any
blockettes, since this function does NOT free any blockettes when initializing
the DATA_HDR structure.


.nf
.br
\f3
integer function f_delete_blockette (hdr, n)
	record /DATA_HDR/ hdr
	integer n
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3f_delete_blockette\f1 will delete all occurances of
blockette n in the DATA_HDR's blockette list.  If n == -1, all blockettes
will be deleted from the DATA_HDR's blockette list.  Fortran users should
call \f3f_delete_blockette(hdr,-1)\f1 after they have finished reading EACH
DATA_HDR or after they have finished with f_ms_pack_data, since each of these
functions may add blockettes to the DATA_HDR structure which will not be
properly freed by the \f3f_init_data_hdr\f1 function.

.SH FORTRAN MINISEED WRITE ROUTINES

The following functions are useful for creating MiniSEED records.
.nf
.br
\f3
integer function f_ms_pack_data (hdr, num_samples, data, n_blocks, mseed, ms_len)
	record /DATA_HDR/ hdr
	integer num_samples
	integer data(num_samples)
	integer n_blocks
	character mseed[ms_len]
	integer ms_len
\f1
.fi
.br
The function \f3f_ms_pack_data\f1 will pack num_samples of integer data into
the required number of MiniSEED records in the mseed string, and return the
number of MiniSEED records created in n_blocks.  The function returns the
number of data samples packed into the MiniSEED records.  The DATA_HDR should
first be initialized with \f3f_init_data_hdr\f1, and must then
be initialized with the station,channel,net, and location information, the
starting time of the first sample, the sample rate, the desired blksize for
the MiniSEED records, and the desired data format.  If the mseed buffer does
not contain sufficient space for all of the MiniSEED records required to
hold num_samples of data, not all of the data will be packed into MiniSEED.
The caller should check the number of samples packed against the num_samples.
.sp
The resulting MiniSEED records may be written to a file using the \f3fio\f1
routines for fortran-callable routines for C buffered and unbufferd I/O.

.br
The subroutine \f3f_add_time\f1 is used to add the specified number of seconds
and usecs to an INT_TIME structure.  The resulting normalize INT_TIME
structure is returned as the value ot.  The seconds and usecs may be either
positive or negative (to add or subtract time).  The seconds are converted
into usecs, the total number of usecs are added to the structure, and the
normalized resulting structure is returned.

.fi
.br
The function \f3f_time_interval2\f1 computes the time spanned by n samples
of data at the specified data rate.  Rate and rate_mult are taken from the
DATA_HDR sample_rate and sample_rate_mult field.  The resulting time span is
returned in the seconds and usecs variables.  For example, 150 samples at
sample rate 100 (100 samples per second) would span 1 second and 500000
usecs (1.5 seconds).

.nf

The function \f3f_dsamples_in_time2\f1 computes the the number of samples that
span the specified time in usecs at the specified sample rate.  Rate and
rate_mult are taken from the DATA_HDR sample_rate and sample_rate_mult
fields respectively and are defined by SEED.  For example, at sample rate
100 (rate=100, rate_mult=1, for 100 samples per second) the span of
1,500,000 usecs (1.5 seconds) would span 100.0 samples of data.

.SH NOTES

1.  The time functions make use of the leapseconds file to tell them when
leapseconds have (and will) occur.  The format of the leapseconds file is
compatible with that of Unix systems that have leapseconds file.  The file
must either be installed as /usr/local/lib/leapseconds or you should set the
environment variable LEAPSECONDS to the pathname of the leapseconds file to
use.  If (for some reason) you do not wish to use a leapseconds file, you
may set LEAPSECONDS to /dev/null, which will suppress any error messages
about a missing leapseconds file.

2.  The library can be built both with and without leapsecond support.
If you use a version of the library without leapsecond support, or
do not have a LEAPSECONDS file, the functions that operate on true
epoch time will be identical to those that operate on nominal epoch time.
