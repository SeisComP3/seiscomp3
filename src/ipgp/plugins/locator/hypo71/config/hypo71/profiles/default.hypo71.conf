TEST(01) = .1    # sec # cutoff RMS value under which Jeffrey's weghting of residuals is not used
TEST(02) = 10.   # km  # 
TEST(03) = 0.2   # critical F-value for the stepwise multiple regression - default value is 2, lower value means more steps
TEST(04) = .01   # km # adjustment value under which Geiger's iteration is terminated - default value is .05, lower value means more steps
TEST(05) = 5.    # km # focal-depth value above which DZ is rest to DZ / (K+1)
TEST(06) = 4.    # regression TEST(03)/TEST(06) coefficient value if no significant variable is found in the stepwise multiple regression
TEST(07) = -.87  # FMA coefficient value for calculating the duration magnitude - not used
TEST(08) = 2.    # FMB coefficient value for calculating the duration magnitude - not used
TEST(09) = .0035 # FMD coefficient value for calculating the duration magnitude - not used
TEST(10) = 2.    # km # coefficient value J = D/TEST(10) used for resetting DX and DY - default value is 100, lower value allows smaller steps
TEST(11) = 999.  # maximum number of iterations in the hypocentral adjustment - default value is 8, computer are now able to handle much more iterations
TEST(12) = .5    # coefficient value DZ = -Z*TEST(12) used for resetting DZ when hypocenter is placed in the air
TEST(13) = 1.    # km # standard error value of hypocentral optionally calculated RMS

## The following values are only available with the Hypo71PC version modified by Alexandre Nercessian (IPGP) which is included with this plugin
TEST(15) = -2.   # km # maximum altitude of earthquake in km (down is positive)
TEST(20) = 1.    # used altitude = read altitude * TEST(20) - for example, -2500 = -250 * 10
