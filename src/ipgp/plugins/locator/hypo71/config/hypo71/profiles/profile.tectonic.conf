## This profile is based on Dorel velocity model for French Antilles
## It allows several iterations at different starting depth for deep and crustal earthquakes

TEST(06) = 4.    # regression TEST(03)/TEST(06) coefficient value if no significant variable is found in the stepwise multiple regression
TEST(10) = 2.  # km # coefficient value J = D/TEST(10) used for resetting DX and DY
TEST(11) = 999.    # maximum number of iterations in the hypocentral adjustment
TEST(12) = .5    # coefficient value DZ = -Z*TEST(12) used for resetting DZ when hypocenter is placed in the air
TEST(13) = 1.    # km # standard error value of hypocentral optionally calculated RMS

## The following values are only available with the Hypo71PC version modified by Alexandre Nercessian (IPGP) which is included with this plugin
TEST(15) = -2.   # km # maximum altitude of earthquake in km (down is positive)
TEST(20) = 1.    # used altitude = read altitude * TEST(20) - for example, -2500 = -250 * 10
