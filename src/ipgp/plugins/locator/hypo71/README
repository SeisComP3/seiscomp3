# HYPO71 is a computer program for determining hypocenter, magnitude,  #
# and first motion pattern of local earthquakes, and was first         #
# released in 1971. It is perhaps the first earthquake location        #
# program that achieved worldwide usage, as evidenced by the fact that #
# about 1,000 copies of the HYPO71 manual were requested and           #
# distributed (Lee, 1990). It is included here for historical          #
# documentation.                                                       #
