Collects reports sent by mail to GEOFON. Processes them. There may be
several reports from a single node for the same period. It is assumed
that these DO NOT overlap. Displays summary reports on a web page.

Requirements:
 - SQLite3
 - PHP 5.2 or so.
 - Gnuplot >=4.6 for some nice summary plots
 - The CSS style sheets used on the EIDA web pages
 - an ounce of good luck

To install on a web server:

 * set up back-end scripts where they can handle mail, should not be servable
   by a web server.

 * copy summary report PHP to a web-servable directory and make sure PHP can
   run there.

 * add a crontab entry to run reqlogstats.sh each day e.g.

     15 07 * * * (cd ${HOME}/reqlogstats; ./reqlogstats.sh) 2>&1


The ./install.sh script provided here may help you.

Adding a new node
-----------------

Try the following, once you have e-mail from the node operator:
 - DON'T run reqlogstats.sh (or reqlogstats_mail.sh)
 - cd reqlogstats; ./split_mail.sh
 - find $HOME/eida_stats -type f -mtime -1 -name "msg*"   # Identify just the valid messages you want to include in the db.
 - echo {valid file names only} | python reqlogstats.py
 - Adjust the database so the new source (e-mail address) is assigned a DCID:

	sqlite3 ~/reqlogstats/var/reqlogstats-2015.db
	SELECT * FROM ArcStatsSource WHERE dcid LIKE '%@%';
	UPDATE ArcStatsSource SET dcid = "KOERI" WHERE dcid="comoglu@boun.edu.tr";
	.quit

   ??? Or reqlogstats.py should do that by itself...

       add the hostname's second to last component (e.g. gfz-potsdam) to the source_dict dictionary in relogstats.py

 - Now on the web page the node should be listed by DCID, not e-mail address
	http://eida.gfz-potsdam.de/eida/reqlogstats/

 - Add the new node in t2.py: it must produce an extra column in the table. Now check graphs are produced correctly...

 - Alter make_month_graph.sh, make_year_graph.sh, make_year_users_graph.sh: adjust the gnuplot commands to colour the new node; check the colours are still assigned correctly.
