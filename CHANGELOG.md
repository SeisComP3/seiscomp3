## Release 2017.320

```SC_API_VERSION 11.0.0```

The database schema has changed since the previous version. To upgrade your
database from version 0.9 to 0.10, please run ```seiscomp update-config scmaster```.
If a database plugin is configured, then it will check the current database
schema version and suggest migration scripts to be run. The output should
look as follows:

```
* starting kernel modules
spread is already running
starting scmaster
* configure scmaster
  * check database write access ... OK
  * database schema version is 0.9
  * last migration version is 0.10
  * migration to the current version is required. apply the following
    scripts in exactly the given order:
    * /home/sysop/seiscomp3/share/db/migrations/mysql/0_9_to_0_10.sql
error: updating configuration for scmaster failed
```

To apply the given script, log into your database server and execute the script.
In mysql it can be done with

```
mysql> source /home/sysop/seiscomp3/share/db/migrations/mysql/0_9_to_0_10.sql;
```

and in psql with

```
seiscomp3=> \i /home/sysop/seiscomp3/share/db/migrations/mysql/0_9_to_0_10.sql;
```

**Rationale**

Most of the inventory objects are valid for certain epochs defined with start
and end time. The database schema did not support microsecond storage of those
times although the structures in the source code do. This schema revision closes
the gap. Furthermore a ResponsePAZ filter could be part of the decimation filter
chain. Therefore the decimation attributes decimationFactor, delay and correction
have been added. Furthermore the ResponseIIR type has been added to correctly
store SEED response coefficients (blockette 54) without the need to convert IIR
filters to poles and zeros.

Furthermore a description of a pdf (probability density function) has been added
to the RealQuantity and TimeQuantity type.

**Important API changes**

***MagnitudeProcessor***

The MagnitudeProcessor interface has changed to support regionalized
magnitude computations. The method ```computeMagnitude``` receives additionally
two parameters, the origin and the sensor location object.
All external magnitude plugins need to be adapted. Change from

```c++
Status computeMagnitude(double amplitude, double period,
                        double delta, double depth, double &value);
```

to

```c++
Status computeMagnitude(double amplitude, double period,
                        double delta, double depth,
#ifdef SC_API_VERSION >= SC_API_VERSION_CHECK(11,0,0)
                        const DataModel::Origin *hypocenter,
                        const DataModel::SensorLocation *receiver,
#endif
                        double &value);
```

Furthermore a new enumeration has been added to return the status of
the magnitude processing: ```EpicenterOutOfRegions```.

***RecordStream***

The RecordStream interface has changed considerably. All ```std::string```
parameters that were passed by value have changed to be passed by const
reference. Due to the rather complicated structure of the RecordStream
interface and its usage in RecordInput, the following methods were removed:

* std::istream& stream()
* Record *createRecord(Array::DataType, Record::Hint)
* void recordStored(Record*)
* bool filterRecord(Record*)

The new interface does deal directly with records and therefore only provides
the single method ```Record *next()```. Iteration stops when a NULL record will
be returned. The advantage is, that an implementation which would route requests
to several backends in parallel such as the balanced recordstream do not need
to deserialize and serialize a record additionally to the application
deserialization. This improves performance and makes it easier to develop more
complex implementations such as a router (which is available as extension from
gempa).

The Python API with respect to RecordInput did not change. You can still use
your old code. Anyone with custom recordstream implementations will have to
port their code.

----

* trunk

  * The API version (```SC_API_VERSION```) is now 11.0.0
  * Set seiscomp3 database bytea encoding to 'escape' for PostgreSQL database
    servers with version >= 9 in postgres.sql script.
  * Add InventorySyncMessage which is used to enclose an inventory synchronization
    process. An application can listen to that message and trigger processing of
    the updated inventory. The InventorySyncMessage is currently sent by
    scinv (seiscomp update inventory) to STATUS_GROUP.
  * Changed default publicID pattern from "@classname@#@time/%Y%m%d%H%M%S.%f@.@id@"
    to "@classname@/@time/%Y%m%d%H%M%S.%f@.@id@". The hash was removed due to
    possible conflicts with QuakeML publicID constraints.
  * FDSNWS recordstream sets default URL path to /fdsnws/dataselect/1/query which
    makes it more easy to use e.g. fdsnws://geofon.gfz-potsdam.de
  * Removed obsolete recordstream **isoarchive**.
  * Removed obsolete Greens function access via Arclink.

* GUI

  * The event list shows status REVIEWED as V, FINAL as F and REPORTED as R
  * Added option to allow map layer visibilities and order
  * Allow to add custom map layers via plugins to the map
  * Refactored Map API (Canvas, Layer, Legend)
  * All GUI applications support an author and/or user blacklist to prevent sending
    messages to scmaster. This is not a proper secure access control implementation
    but helps to setup read-only applications to avoid accidental commits.
    ```
    blacklist.users = sysop1, sysop2
    blacklist.authors = sysop1@host, sysop2@host
    ```
  * Map layer drawing properties may be additionally defined in a "map.cfg" file
    located in the data set folder and subfolder, e.g. ```~/.seiscomp3/fep/map.cfg```,
    ```~/.seiscomp3/bna/map.cfg```, ```~/.seiscomp3/bna/category/map.cfg```.
  * Added support for event summary to listen to alert comments and adapt size and color
    of time ago label accordingly.

* scmm

  * Added the module documentation.

* scmv

  * Added option ```expiredEventsInterval``` which controls the interval to check for expired events.
    The default value is 0 and does disable the interval check.
  * Added option to show the event table initially and to configure visible columns
    ```
    eventTable.visible = true
    eventTable.columns = Event, Depth
    ```
  * Add legend for event symbols

* scolv

  * ```locator.minimumDepth``` is now deprecated in favour of ```olv.locator.minimumDepth```
  * ```olv.locator``` is now deprecated in favour of ```olv.locator.interface```
  * Add option to configure the default checkstate of the event association button and
    fix origin button of the popup for committing with additional options: ```olv.commit.forceEventAssociation```
    and ```olv.commit.fixOrigin```. Either default value is true.
  * Add system tray icon which shows a notification if a new event
    has been detected. This can be disabled with
    ```
    olv.systemTray = false
    ```
  * Replace single arrival usage flag with three separate usage flags: time used,
    backazimuth used and horizontal slowness used which can also be toggled
    separately

* scrttv

  * Normalize visible amplitudes (S) now toggles between normalizing amplitudes
    of the currently visible time window (true) or the entire trace (false). The
    old behaviour caused traces to degenerate into a straight line if the data buffer
    runs out the time window which was used to normalize amplitudes.

* scqc

  * Added configuration option ```use3Components``` that allows to use all
    3 components of a configured station. This only applies if ```useConfiguredStreams```
    is active (default).

* scinv

  * Print file source of conflicting definitions

* seiscomp

  * An init script can not forward its configuration to another module. This is
    especially useful if e.g. ```seiscomp update-config scautopick``` is ran
    which did not do anything. Now it forwards its configuration to module
    *trunk* and will update the bindings database. The old behaviour has always
    confused users.

* dlsv2inv

  * Improve conversion to SC3. Many thanks to Arnaud Lemarchand from IPGP France
    for his exhaustive tests and valuable advises.
  * Add station and channel comment support

* fdsnxml2inv

  * Improve conversion to SC3. Many thanks to Arnaud Lemarchand from IPGP France
    for his exhaustive tests and valuable advises.
  * Declare NumeratorCoefficient.i as optional according to the official schema. Before
    that change, a lot of responses failed to convert.
  * Do not populate NumeratorCoefficient.i when converting to FDSNXML to avoid
    bloating the XML.
  * Add station and channel comment support

* scsohlog

  * Add description and documentation

* scbulletin

  * Add option -e for enhanced output at higher precision.

* seedlink

  * Removed option -C from nmxptool plugin template. This should go into the
    additional options parameter.

* arclink *

  * Removed ```isodir``` option
  * Removed obsolete GREENSFUNC request type

* Hypo71

  * Fix a bug when all arrivals uncertainties where not set
  * Fix a bug in Hypo71PC for earthquakes near longitude 0 and longitude 180
    Thanks to M. Sylvander from IRAP/OMP France for finding and fixing this.

## Release 2017.124

* seiscomp

  * Use symbolic links to module defaults and configurations instead of
    copying when creating module aliases

* doc

  * Added plugin section to module documentation with all documented
    plugins

* spread

  * Upgraded to version 4.4

* LocSAT

  * Started to clean up code and to remove f2c dependencies. Goal of this
    was to make compute_tt work in subsequent calls. Prior to the changes
    travel time computation with LocSAT gave unpredictable results which
    is now fixed.

* scconfig

  * Fixed issue with deleted structures when saving a configuration file.
    Prior to that fix the structure was not deleted.
  * Added documentation section which allows to browse changelogs and
    documentations of installed modules

* scautopick

  * Added the option ```killPendingSPickers``` to configure whether to
    terminate pending secondary processors if a new detection has been
    found or not. The downside of disabling that is that two picks will
    be possibly sent: a P and an S pick.

* GUI

  * Fixed bug in map tilestore that caused custom tilestore implementations
    to crash under certain circumstances
  * Add option to show times in localtime
    ```
    scheme.dateTime.useLocalTime = true
    ```
    This will show (hopefully) all times in the GUI with respect to the
    systems timezone instead of UTC.

* scesv

  * Fixed crash if no event was loaded and either "Show full tensor" or
    "Show waveform propagation" was toggled

* scrttv

  * If loading data from a file then all data is loaded and --buffer-size
    is being ignored. Furthermore XML event parameter files can be loaded
    (File->Open) and picks will be shown on top of loaded traces.

* scolv

  * Show symbols for unassociated station by default up to 360 degrees.
    This distance Can be changed with:
    ```
    # Show unassociated stations up to 20 degrees
    olv.map.stations.unassociatedMaxDist = 20
    ```
  * Apply show spectrogram values initially
  * Use separate trace color if spectrogram is shown: ```scheme.colors.records.spectrogram```
  * Read and apply scolv/global bindings to the repicker

* scmv

  * Add "Show Details" button to event details widget

* scevent

  * Added parameter to also compare picks that are associated with
    weight 0
    ```
    eventAssociation.allowLooseAssociatedArrivals = true
    ```
  * Added region check plugin that allows to configure a list of arbitrary
    regions and to set the event type to "outside of network interest" if
    its location is outside any region configured.

* scevtls

  * Added --modified-after option

* dlsv2inv, fdsnxml2inv

  * Make sample rate conversion from float to fraction more stable

* fdsnxml2inv

  * Fix epoch creation of sensor locations for some channel epoch
    combinations which caused the creation of two sensor locations
    with split epochs

* fdsnws

  * Make arclink-access bindings optional through configuration parameter
    useArclinkAccess
  * Add option ```recordBulkSize``` which defaults to 100kb and improves
    the dataselect performance significantly

* seedlink

  * Added ps2400_eth plugin configuration

* sh2proc

  * New Python tool to convert SeismicHandler event files to SC3XML


## Release 2016.333

The database schema has changed since the previous version. To upgrade your
database from version 0.8 to 0.9 to following SQL script can be used:


**MYSQL**

```sql
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD creationInfo_agencyID VARCHAR(64);
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD creationInfo_agencyURI VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD creationInfo_author VARCHAR(128);
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD creationInfo_authorURI VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD creationInfo_creationTime DATETIME;
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD creationInfo_creationTime_ms INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD creationInfo_modificationTime DATETIME;
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD creationInfo_modificationTime_ms INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD creationInfo_version VARCHAR(64);
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD creationInfo_used TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0';

UPDATE Meta SET value='0.9' WHERE name='Schema-Version';
```

**PostgreSQL**

```sql
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD m_creationInfo_agencyID VARCHAR(64);
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD m_creationInfo_agencyURI VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD m_creationInfo_author VARCHAR(128);
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD m_creationInfo_authorURI VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD m_creationInfo_creationTime TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD m_creationInfo_creationTime_ms INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD m_creationInfo_modificationTime TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD m_creationInfo_modificationTime_ms INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD m_creationInfo_version VARCHAR(64);
ALTER TABLE ConfigStation ADD m_creationInfo_used BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT '0';

UPDATE Meta SET value='0.9' WHERE name='Schema-Version';
```

**Rationale**

The ConfigStation object will be updated by three instances in SeisComP3:
```seiscomp update-config```, ```scrttv``` and ```scqcv```. To track which
module has disabled or enabled a particular station the CreationInfo
structure has been added to ConfigStation.

## Release 2015.040

**WARNING:** Due to a fixed bug in the amplitude calculation if deconvolution is enabled the processing of amplitudes introduces now a delay of 60s unless
configured otherwise. Background: the default cosine taper time window length has been left unchanged for now and is still 60s at either side. To not affect
the signal time window the taper must start at signal end and thus 60s more data are required. That is usually not necessary and too much. Upcoming releases
will set the default to 5s but for now it is 60s. The configuration of "amplitudes.[type].resp.taper" in global bindings can fix it. As an override the following
changes can be applied to global.cfg:

``` c++
module.trunk.global.amplitudes.ML.resp.taper = 5.0
module.trunk.global.amplitudes.MLv.resp.taper = 5.0
module.trunk.global.amplitudes.MLh.resp.taper = 5.0
module.trunk.global.amplitudes.mb.resp.taper = 5.0
module.trunk.global.amplitudes.mB.resp.taper = 5.0
module.trunk.global.amplitudes.Mwp.resp.taper = 5.0
```

* seiscomp

 * Refuse to run as root unless "--asroot" is passed

   ```
   $ sudo seiscomp help
   [sudo] password for sysop:
   Running seiscomp as root is dangerous. Use --asroot if you know what you are doing
   $ sudo seiscomp --asroot help
   Available commands:

     ...
   ```

* VS

 * Fixed installation of !VsMag Python libraries if wrappers are disabled

* scvsmaglog

 * Event ID added to the email subject
 * Additional configuration options enable operating several instances of scvsmaglog

* scenvelope

 * The default message group for envelope messages is now AMPLITUDE. Adding the message group VS is therefore no longer needed.

* scvsmag

 * Fixing a bug in reading Vs30 files for amplitude correction (thanks Palmi Erlendsson for spotting it!)
 * Fixing a bug in magnitude computation: the proxy for the frequency content of the earthquake signal is now taken into account in MVS.
 * Fixing a bug in the computation of the pick rate
 * The computation of the likelihood quantifying the quality of the VS alert has been slightly modified (see documentation of scvsmag for details)
 * The azimuthal gap is used as an additional quality criterion
 * VS envelope messages are now received by default from the message group AMPLITUDE

* ud_interface

 * Use xslt files to format AMQ messages

* Trunk

 * Added default port 80 to FDSN Webservice RecordStream
 * Made Helmberger format with 10 component files work with Green's functions
 * Removed gain correction (if gain was defined outside the target frequency of interest) and rely on operator to define reasonable Gains in inventory files

 * Fixed compilation of GUI tree if boost is installed in non-standard location
 * Added "no-batch" option to Seedlink recordstream to connect to Seedlink servers that do not support BATCH requests
 * Fixed Seedlink connection with respect to reconnect that caused restart of the entire request
 * Fixed mapping to event type 'other' in QuakeML converter
 * Removed StationXML support which is superseded by FDSNXML
 * Create more database indexes as suggested by Fabian Engels
 * LocSAT: take weight into account when locate with a picklist
 * Allow to configure usage of responses per amplitude type
 * Clip MLv and Ms(BB) time window to given signalEnd
 * Added amplitude check for valid range if computing magnitudes
 * Return correct status if distance is out of range for ML
 * AmplitudeProcessor moved deconvolution cosine taper start to signal end to not damp the amplitudes

* GUI

 * Added scheme.precision.uncertainties description

* scolv

 * Show acquisition errors in a message box
 * Added smart layout mode to focal mechanism map
 * Group by agency for focal mechanisms
 * Added option picker.ignoreUnconfiguredStations to add only stations that are configured with "detecStream" when adding stations in a certain range
 * Added option to define picker alignment position: picker.alignmentPosition
 * Set computeMissingTakeOffAngles to true by default
 * Fixed crash when computing magnitudes
 * Populate Pick.filterID with currently active filter
 * Crash if raw data is shown in amplitude view and the time window is changed

* hypo71

 * Fixed bug when a pick has been deactivated in scolv
 * Fixed "fixed depth" issue
 * Removed OPTIONAL flag for Fortran compiler check if HYPO build is enabled

* fdsnws

 * Added hideAuthor config parameter

 * Fixed output for XML if only an origin(ID) is given

* dlsv2inv

 * Added support for TEMPERATURE and PRESSURE channels when converting PAZ responses

* screloc

 * Added commandline option "dump" and "profile" to dump results in XML to stdout and to set a locator profile

* scautoloc

 * Added parameter autoloc.stationLocations to description

* scdbstrip

 * Disable daemon mode

* scimport

 * Reconnect to sink until connection can be established during init

* scautopick

 * Populate Pick.filterID with currently active filter

* scevent

 * Config parameters are float rather than int (Marc Grunberg)

* scwfparam

 * Use significant duration as processing time window scaled by optional durationScale parameter, replaced sensitivity correction filter by post-deconvolution filter
 * Replaced "2nd filter" with "filter" and use t05+duration*x
 * Implemented requested XML changes
 * Fixed invalid description file

* scconfig

 * Log XML file which produced an error

* Seedlink

 * lib330 update
 * Fixed Antelope ORB plugin setup
 * Added global access parameter configuration

* NLL

 * Applied patches from Anthony Lomax and Romane Racine (Swiss Seismological Service)

* Known bugs

 * scwfparam produces wrong amplitudes if deconvolution or acausal filtering is enabled.
