3. Amendment agreement for commercial usage

3.1 Definition

Permission for commercial usage is granted neither by the SeisComP Public
License nor the SeisComP Binary License. Examples of commercial purposes would
be running business operations, licensing, leasing, or selling the software,
distributing the software in a product to customers for evaluation purposes,
distributing the software for use with commercial products, using the software
in the creation or use of commercial products or any other activity which
purpose is to procure a commercial gain to you or others. For avoidance of doubt
Commercial Purposes would be also all services offered for a valuable
consideration such as for example training, installation, maintenance and
development or modification. All such commercial activities need the prior
written authorization by GFZ. Users requiring commercial support have to ensure
that the assigned service provider is holding a valid commercial license.

3.2 License fee

The right for commercial use of the Program (incl. the parts covered by the
SeiscomP Public License and the SeiscomP Binary License) is subject to a license
fee. The amount of the license fee will be negotiated as the case arises.

3.3 Third-party installations

It is only allowed to install the Program at a third party in case a separate
